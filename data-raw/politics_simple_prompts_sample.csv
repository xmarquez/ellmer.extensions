"I'm going to give you the lyrics of a song by ""6LACK"" entitled ""Pretty Little Fears"" from 2018. Here are the lyrics:

[Verse 1: 6LACK]
Do better, who better? You better?
Been around, like hella propellers
Wanna know who you with, don't tell 'em
Come on, fellas, that ain't none of your biz'
Got on your bodysuit, you know I'm on your ass today
Would you let me hit it thrice if I asked today?
She know my stick nuttin' but magic, babe
I be swinging it back and forth 'til you in your casket, bae, mmm

[Pre-Chorus: 6LACK]
Girl, you want my best side, mmm
Bet she from the Westside, mmm, mmm

[Chorus: 6LACK]
Now I just wanna know
Don't you sugarcoat
I'll say it all if you want
Now could you tell me like it is?
Pretty little fears
Music to my ears

[Verse 2: 6LACK]
Okay, say it loud, say it proud, you want it more
We open door, hit the couch, then the floor
I cut it up, like a scissor, love galore
She never bored, there's so much shit we can do
You free to say whatever, baby, if you asking me
No limit when I'm in it, got a Master P
I'm hoping I don't have a fast release
Got me focused like I'm out here tryna get my mast to sea, mmm

[Pre-Chorus: 6LACK]
Throwin' up the peace sign, hmm
Girl, I'm from the Eastside, mmm, mmm
Girl, you on my best side, mmm
Say she from the Westside, mmm, mmm

[Chorus: 6LACK]
Now I just wanna know
Don't you sugarcoat
I'll say it all if you want
Now could you tell me like it is?
Pretty little fears
Music to my ears
Now I just wanna know
Don't you sugarcoat
I'll say it all if you want
Now could you tell me like it is?
Pretty little fears
Music to my ears

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
I'm loving your light, vulnerable
Letting your guard down, it's honorable
'Specially when the past ain't been that
Friendly to you, but there's magic in that
You the flower that I gotta protect
And keep alive in the winter time, ayy, don't you die yet
You been way more than a friend of mine, we more like fam
I raise you, you raise me, let's turn this whole life 'round
You can confide in me
I could take the weight up off your shoulder blades and try to store the pain inside of me
Ayy, why the world do you like that?
Like they don't know you God-sent, but me, I view you like that
I'm sneaking glances, thanking God that he drew you like that
Beautiful Black child, come and shed your black cloud
For your vibe and your smile, I don't mind a lil' rain
I'm your dog, ears perk up at the sound of your name
Count on your main, wildfire, can't handle your flame
Download your shame, wild high, come drown in your fragrance
You that red pill that a nigga found in the Matrix
Before I had you, this shit was fantasy
You plant a seed to grow some roots, a branch and leaves
Becomes a tree of life until our nights are filled
With peace from stress and strife
And that's the blessing that I get from wifing you
'Cause you entrusted me with the key to your heart
Beating you smart, 'cause even though I need a new start
Due to my past transgressions, you believed in me
I guess the light I see in you is what you see in me, Lord

[Pre-Chorus: J. Cole]
Say she from the Westside, mmm
And she see my best side, mmm, mmm

[Chorus: 6LACK]
Now I just wanna know
Don't you sugarcoat
I'll say it all if you want
Now could you tell me like it is?

"I'm going to give you the lyrics of a song by ""A Boogie wit da Hoodie"" entitled ""Say A’"" from 2017. Here are the lyrics:

[Intro]
Ness on the beat
...the fuck I'm supposed to say?
What the fuck I'm supposed to say? Ayy

[Chorus]
What the fuck I'm supposed to say?
Police pull me over, they ain't got nothing to say
I told 'em, ""I got tints because I'm rich"", they said, ""Okay"", ayy
Gotta pray a lot, niggas get shot up everyday, ayy
Hold up, what the fuck I'm supposed to say?
Police pull me over, they ain't got nothing to say
I told 'em, ""I got tints because I'm rich"", they said, ""Okay"", ayy
Gotta pray a lot, niggas get shot up everyday, ayy
Heard you got a big body but a little face, ayy
Got a 41 bezel, it's 100K, ayy
If I feel a way then I'm gon' say it to your face, ayy
If I play the block today, I'll make 100K, ayy

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I just might make 100K, yeah
If they put a price on me, I'll double what they pay, yeah
They say they don't like me, give a fuck 'bout what they say, yeah
I could take your bitch and make you think about what you say, yeah
I'm gon' put her in a leg lock like MMA, yeah
I'm gon' let her give me head twice if she don't say shit
If she ever turn sherm on me then she basic
Couple bitches, had to swerve on 'em, I updated
You pulled up with her, she ain't leave with who she came with
She deserve better, you's a bird, you's a wasteman
Fuck a umbrella, change weather in my spaceship
Diamonds dancing, I'm two-stepping with my bracelet
So, get the fuck up out my face
I'm just on my way to get this money and I'm late, okay
In the strip club, throwing twenties like ""I'll be okay""
100k a day, trap booming like an 808

[Chorus]
Yeah, what the fuck I'm supposed to say?
Police pull me over, they ain't got nothing to say
I told 'em, ""I got tints because I'm rich"", they said, ""Okay"", ayy
Gotta pray a lot, niggas get shot up everyday, ayy
Heard you got a big body but a little face, ayy
Got a 41 bezel, it's 100K, ayy
If I feel a way then I'm gon' say it to your face, ayy
If I play the block today, I'll make 100K, ayy

[Verse 2]
Hold up, talking shit don't ever get to me
When they see me now, they'd better have that same energy
In abandoned houses, in and out, it wasn't shit to me
When you see me now, don't try to act like you remember me
They look at me now, bitch I'm drownin'
And my hoodie Saint Laurent, it's a thousand
And we come straight out the Bronx so we wildin'
Shoutout BK, free Bobby and free Rowdy
Free my nigga V12, holla if you see twelve
Febreze, believe me, it'll cover the weed smell
I probably got three mil', sittin' in my email
So much on me, they second guessin' what we sell
So much money on me, fuck it if it's dirty money
'Cause I earned it, you get murked if you come searchin' for me
When the police pulled me over, I had thirty on me
What the fuck I look like with less than thirty on me, nigga?

[Chorus]
Yeah, what the fuck I'm supposed to say?
Police pull me over, they ain't got nothing to say
I told 'em, ""I got tints because I'm rich"", they said, ""Okay"", ayy
Gotta pray a lot, niggas get shot up everyday, ayy
Heard you got a big body but a little face, ayy
Got a 41 bezel, it's 100K, ayy
If I play the block today, I'll make 100K, ayy
If I play the block today, I'll make 100K, yeah

[Chorus]
What the fuck I'm supposed to say?
Police pull me over, they ain't got nothing to say
I told 'em, ""I got tints because I'm rich"", they said, ""Okay"", ayy
Gotta pray a lot, niggas get shot up everyday, ayy
Hold up, what the fuck I'm supposed to say?

If I play the block today, I'll make 100K, ayy

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I just might make 100K, yeah
If they put a price on me, I'll double what they pay, yeah
They say they don't like me, give a fuck 'bout what they say, yeah
I could take your bitch and make you think about what you say, yeah
I'm gon' put her in a leg lock like MMA, yeah
I'm gon' let her give me head twice if she don't say shit
If she ever turn sherm on me then she basic
Couple bitches, had to swerve on 'em, I updated
You pulled up with her, she ain't leave with who she came with
She deserve better, you's a bird, you's a wasteman
Fuck a umbrella, change weather in my spaceship
Diamonds dancing, I'm two-stepping with my bracelet
So, get the fuck up out my face
I'm just on my way to get this money and I'm late, okay
In the strip club, throwing twenties like ""I'll be okay""
100k a day, trap booming like an 808

[Chorus]
Yeah, what the fuck I'm supposed to say?
Police pull me over, they ain't got nothing to say
I told 'em, ""I got tints because I'm rich"", they said, ""Okay"", ayy

If I play the block today, I'll make 100K, ayy

[Verse 2]
Hold up, talking shit don't ever get to me
When they see me now, they'd better have that same energy
In abandoned houses, in and out, it wasn't shit to me
When you see me now, don't try to act like you remember me
They look at me now, bitch I'm drownin'
And my hoodie Saint Laurent, it's a thousand
And we come straight out the Bronx so we wildin'
Shoutout BK, free Bobby and free Rowdy
Free my nigga V12, holla if you see twelve
Febreze, believe me, it'll cover the weed smell
I probably got three mil', sittin' in my email
So much on me, they second guessin' what we sell
So much money on me, fuck it if it's dirty money
'Cause I earned it, you get murked if you come searchin' for me
When the police pulled me over, I had thirty on me
What the fuck I look like with less than thirty on me, nigga?

[Chorus]
Yeah, what the fuck I'm supposed to say?

"I'm going to give you the lyrics of a song by ""ABC"" entitled ""Vanity Kills"" from 1986. Here are the lyrics:

Have you heard the latest? (You love you)
Have you seen who just walked in? (Vain, vain, vain, vain)
(Uh-huh, you love you) Right over there
(She's so vain, vain, vain, vain)

(Vain, vain, vain, vain)

I'm glad you've found someone who loves you
But sad to say that someone is you
And now perhaps you'll both be happy
Guess that makes two, just you and you
Someone who cares so much about you
But does that someone have to be you

Vanity kills, it don't pay bills
Vanity kills, you love you
Vanity kills, it don't pay bills
Vanity kills, it kills

(Vain, vain, vain, vain)

So glad I found you glancing in the mirror
Gazing deeply at love's patron saint
Admire the frame, survey the scenery
Or are you just inspecting the paint?
Temptation's strong, modesty's so weak
High on yourself, humble you ain't

Vanity kills, it don't pay bills
Vanity kills, you love you
Vanity kills, it don't pay bills

"I'm going to give you the lyrics of a song by ""Bobby Vinton"" entitled ""The Days of Sand and Shovels"" from 1972. Here are the lyrics:

When I noticed her the first time
I was outside running barefoot in the rain
She lived in the house next door
Her nose was pressed against the window pane
When I looked at her she smiled
And showed a place where two teeth used to be
And I heard her ask her mom if she
Could come outside and play with me
Soon the day's of sand and shovels
Gave way to the mysteries of life
Then I noticed she was changing and I
Looked at her through different eyes
We became as one and knew a love
Without beginning or an end
And everyday I lived with her
Was like a new day dawning once again

And I've loved her since every doll was Shirley Temple
Soda pop was still a nickel
Jam was on her fingertips
Milk was circled on her lips
After many years our live grew
Silent and at night I heard her cry
And when she left me in the fall I knew
That it would be our last goodbye
I was man enough to give her
Everything she needed for a while
And searching for a perfect love
I found that I could not give her a child
Now she lives a quiet life
And is the mother of a little girl
Every time I pass her house
My thoughts go back into another world
Because I see her little girl
Her nose is pressed against the window pane
She thinks I'm a lonely man
Who wants to come inside out of the rain
And I've loved her since every doll was shirley Temple
Soda pop was still a nickel
Jam was on her fingertips
Milk was circled on her lips

And is the mother of a little girl
Every time I pass her house
My thoughts go back into another world
Because I see her little girl
Her nose is pressed against the window pane

"I'm going to give you the lyrics of a song by ""Bobby Vinton"" entitled ""The Days of Sand and Shovels"" from 1972. Here are the lyrics:

When I noticed her the first time
I was outside running barefoot in the rain
She lived in the house next door
Her nose was pressed against the window pane
When I looked at her she smiled
And showed a place where two teeth used to be
And I heard her ask her mom if she
Could come outside and play with me
Soon the day's of sand and shovels
Gave way to the mysteries of life
Then I noticed she was changing and I
Looked at her through different eyes
We became as one and knew a love
Without beginning or an end
And everyday I lived with her
Was like a new day dawning once again

And I've loved her since every doll was Shirley Temple
Soda pop was still a nickel
Jam was on her fingertips
Milk was circled on her lips
After many years our live grew
Silent and at night I heard her cry
And when she left me in the fall I knew
That it would be our last goodbye
I was man enough to give her
Everything she needed for a while
And searching for a perfect love
I found that I could not give her a child
Now she lives a quiet life
And is the mother of a little girl
Every time I pass her house
My thoughts go back into another world
Because I see her little girl
Her nose is pressed against the window pane
She thinks I'm a lonely man
Who wants to come inside out of the rain
And I've loved her since every doll was shirley Temple
Soda pop was still a nickel
Jam was on her fingertips
Milk was circled on her lips

I need time, love, joy
I need space, love
I need... me
(Action!)

[Verse 1]
Say hello to the girl that I am
You're gonna have to see through my perspective
I need to make mistakes just to learn who I am
And I don't wanna be so damn protected

[Pre-Chorus]
There must be another way
'Cause I believe in taking chances
But who am I to say what a girl is to do?
God, I need some answers

[Chorus]
What am I to do with my life? (You will find it out, don't worry)
How am I supposed to know what's right? (You just gotta do it your way)
I can't help the way I feel
But my life has been so overprotected

[Verse 2]
I'll tell 'em what I like, what I want, and what I don't
But every time I do, I stand corrected
Things that I've been told, I can't believe what I hear about the world
I realize I'm overprotected

[Pre-Chorus]
There must be another way
'Cause I believe in taking chances
But who am I to say what a girl is to do?
God, I need some answers

[Chorus]
What am I to do with my life? (You will find it out, don't worry)
How am I supposed to know what's right? (You just gotta do it your way)
I can't help the way I feel (Help the way I feel)
But my life has been so overprotected

[Interlude]
I need time, love
I need space
(This is it)

[Bridge]
I don't need nobody telling me just what I wanna
What I, what, what, what I'm gonna (I need) do about my destiny
I say no, no, nobody's telling me just what I wanna do, do
I'm so fed up with people telling me to be someone else but me (Action!)

[Chorus]
What am I to do with my life? (You will find it out, don't worry)
How am I supposed to know what's right? (You just gotta do it your way)

"I'm going to give you the lyrics of a song by ""Brooks & Dunn"" entitled ""Rock My World (Little Country Girl)"" from 1994. Here are the lyrics:

[Verse 1]
She's got a T-Top Camaro with a scoop on the hood
And two big speakers blastin' Johnny B. Goode
Lookin' so sweet it oughta be a crime
She plays with my heart and messes with my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
Acts like Madonna but she listens to Merle
Rock my world little country girl

[Verse 2]
She wears snakeskin boots made by Calvin Klein
And cheap sunglasses from the five and dime
All the other girls in school, they give her dirty looks
She got a ""A"" in math and never cracked a book

[Pre-Chorus]
Sure looks good in her denim and pearls
Rock my world little country girl

[Chorus]
Rock my world, drag me out on the floor
Dance with me 'til I can't dance anymore
One-step, two-step, get in a line
I gotta find a way to make you mine
Rock my world
Woo

[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
I tell her that I love her but it ain't enough
She says I got to learn to loosen up
Get a little wild on Saturday night
But make sure she's home before the mornin' light

[Pre-Chorus]
Sunday, she's all ribbons and curls
Rock my world little country girl

[Chorus]
Rock my world, drag me out on the floor
Dance with me 'til I can't dance anymore
One-step, two-step, get in a line
I gotta find a way to make you mine

[Verse 1]
Ayy, ayy, ayy
I got a condo in Manhattan
Baby girl, what's happenin'?
You and your ass invited
So go on and get to clappin'
So pop it for a player
Pop, pop it for me
Turn around and drop it for a player
Drop, drop it for me
I'll rent a beach house in Miami (-ami)
Wake up with no jammies (Nope)
Lobster tail for dinner
Julio, serve that scampi (Julio!)
You got it if you want it
Got, got it if you want it
Said, you got it if you want it
Take my wallet if you want it now

[Pre-Chorus]
Jump in the Cadillac, girl, let's put some miles on it
Anything you want, just to put a smile on it
You deserve it, baby, you deserve it all
And I'm gonna give it to you

[Chorus]
Gold jewelry shinin' so bright
Strawberry champagne on ice
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like

Silk sheets and diamonds all white
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like

Say the word and we go (Say it)
You can be my freaka (Brrrt!)
Girl, I'll be your fleeko, Mamacita
I will never make a promise that I can't keep
I promise that your smile ain't gon' ever leave
Shoppin' sprees in Paris
Everything 24 karats
Take a look in that mirror
Now, tell me, who's the fairest?
Is it you? (Is it you?) Is it me? (Is it me?)
Say it's us (Say it's us) and I'll agree, baby

Act a fool, you better watch out
Hot shit be bringin the' cops out
Street niggas is ringin' them shots out
Short circuit and blacken the blocks out
Now open up the garage and pull the drops out
Rockin the fur coat bringin' the blue fox out
Diamonds light up the block, runnin' the blue rocks out
Wildin' 'til all of my crew knocks out
Get yo' ass up on the floor
Huh, throw ya hands if you wan't some more
Baby, wiggle your crotch out, huh
And peep the way we be blowin' them spots out
C'mon, look how we got 'em ready to act out
Girl, I'm ready to give it twistin' your back out
Drink 'yack 'til a nigga fallin' out
Flat on his back now watch a nigga crawlin' out, talk to me

[Chorus: Pharell & Busta Rhymes]
I said Busta (Wassup son?)
You leave them girls rollin' and it look like (C'mon)
They asses is swollen (And they ass gettin big now)
But if your man babysittin' (uh-huh) then what you gon' say?
(What we gon' tell 'em man?)
We gon' tell that nigga (Pass the Courvoisier)
We gon' tell that brotha (Pass the Courvoisier)
Everybody sing it now (Pass the Courvoisier)
Everybody sing it now (Pass the Courvoisier)

Too much hair on your cho-cha, shave it off
C'mon, jump smack yo' ass and break it off
And if it's too hot for y'all? You need to take it off
In case you ain't knowin' niggas we on a roll now
Diddy, like we done stumbled on a pot of gold now, c'mon
Food spillin' all out of the bowl now, huh
Money thick, get harder to fold now, c'mon
Ladies tell me if you're feelin (Alright)
And are you sure that you up for doin it (All night)
I like this
Listen, before you ass bet, nigga
We wreck shit and we ain't even blacked yet
Niggas all around and police rapidly shut down the block
And the club ain't even packed yet, c'mon
Nuff drinkin at the bar hold it down wildin' out 'til the club is closed down, talk to me

[Chorus: Pharell & Busta Rhymes]
I said Busta (Wassup son?)
You leave them girls rollin' and it look like (C'mon)
They asses is swollen (And they ass gettin big now)
But if your man babysittin' (uh-huh) then what you gon' say?
(What we gon' tell 'em man?)
We gon' tell that nigga (Pass the Courvoisier)
We gon' tell that brotha (Pass the Courvoisier)

"I'm going to give you the lyrics of a song by ""Carly Simon"" entitled ""Haven’t Got Time For The Pain"" from 1974. Here are the lyrics:

[Verse 1]
All those crazy nights when I cried myself to sleep
Now melodrama never makes me weep anymore

[Chorus]
'Cause I haven't got time for the pain
I haven't got room for the pain
I haven't the need for the pain
Not since I've known you

[Verse 2]
You showed me how, how to leave myself behind
How to turn down the noise in my mind

[Chorus]
Now I haven't got time for the pain
I haven't got room for the pain
I haven't the need for the pain
Not since I've known you
I haven't got time for the pain
I haven't got room for the pain
I haven't the need for the pain
Not since I've known you

[Verse 3]
Suffering was the only thing, made me feel I was alive
Thought that's just how much it cost to survive in this world
'Til you showed me how, how to fill my heart with love
How to open up and drink in all that white light
Pouring down from the Heaven

[Chorus]
Haven't got time for the pain (No pain)
I haven't got room for the pain (No pain)
I haven't the need for the pain (Ahh)
Not since I've known you

[Bridge]
I haven't got time for the pain (I haven't got time for the pain)
Haven't got room or the need for the pain (I haven't got room for the pain)
No, I haven't got time, I haven't got time (I haven't the need for the pain)
No, I haven't got time for the pain (I haven't got time for the pain)
I haven't got room for the pain, no no no (I haven't got room for the pain)
I haven't the need for the pain, no no no (I haven't the need for the pain)
No need or the time (I haven't got time for the pain)
No no, no time for the pain (I haven't got room for the pain)

All those crazy nights when I cried myself to sleep
Now melodrama never makes me weep anymore

[Chorus]
'Cause I haven't got time for the pain
I haven't got room for the pain
I haven't the need for the pain
Not since I've known you

[Verse 2]
You showed me how, how to leave myself behind
How to turn down the noise in my mind

[Chorus]
Now I haven't got time for the pain
I haven't got room for the pain
I haven't the need for the pain
Not since I've known you
I haven't got time for the pain
I haven't got room for the pain
I haven't the need for the pain
Not since I've known you

[Verse 3]
Suffering was the only thing, made me feel I was alive
Thought that's just how much it cost to survive in this world
'Til you showed me how, how to fill my heart with love
How to open up and drink in all that white light
Pouring down from the Heaven

[Chorus]
Haven't got time for the pain (No pain)
I haven't got room for the pain (No pain)
I haven't the need for the pain (Ahh)
Not since I've known you

[Bridge]
I haven't got time for the pain (I haven't got time for the pain)
Haven't got room or the need for the pain (I haven't got room for the pain)
No, I haven't got time, I haven't got time (I haven't the need for the pain)
No, I haven't got time for the pain (I haven't got time for the pain)
I haven't got room for the pain, no no no (I haven't got room for the pain)
I haven't the need for the pain, no no no (I haven't the need for the pain)
No need or the time (I haven't got time for the pain)
No no, no time for the pain (I haven't got room for the pain)
It's all in my past, no no, no no no

[Intro]
Ready, set
Let's roll, let's roll

[Verse 1]
Damn, pretty girl, you went and done it again
You gone and turned your sexy all the way up to ten
I've never seen a side ride seat looking so hot
Baby, you rock, hit the spot like a Fireball shot
You got me all high, head spinning around and around
I'm down if you're down to burn down this town

[Chorus]
Ready, set, let's roll
Ready, set, let's ride
Get your little fine ass on the step, shimmy up inside
Then slide, girl, by my side, girl
Yeah, we can run this town, I can rock your world
We can roll 'em down, fog 'em up, cruise around, get stuck
Pedal to the metal 'til the sun comes up
I made a deal with the man on the moon
He's gonna put in some overtime, we got all night
Ready, set, let's roll (Let's roll)
Ready, set, let's ride (Let's ride)

[Verse 2]
Ready, set, let's roll where the good years and good times meet
Girl, we can rev it up right 'til we overheat
Just forget about the time, get your lips on mine
Gotta kiss you, get to know your smile
On your mark, get set

Ready, set
Let's roll, let's roll

[Verse 1]
Damn, pretty girl, you went and done it again
You gone and turned your sexy all the way up to ten
I've never seen a side ride seat looking so hot
Baby, you rock, hit the spot like a Fireball shot
You got me all high, head spinning around and around
I'm down if you're down to burn down this town

Ready, set, let's roll
Ready, set, let's ride
Get your little fine ass on the step, shimmy up inside
Then slide, girl, by my side, girl
Yeah, we can run this town, I can rock your world
We can roll 'em down, fog 'em up, cruise around, get stuck
Pedal to the metal 'til the sun comes up
I made a deal with the man on the moon
He's gonna put in some overtime, we got all night
Ready, set, let's roll (Let's roll)
Ready, set, let's ride (Let's ride)

[Verse 2]
Ready, set, let's roll where the good years and good times meet
Girl, we can rev it up right 'til we overheat
Just forget about the time, get your lips on mine
Gotta kiss you, get to know your smile
On your mark, get set

Baby, when December comes, when it's gettin' cold outside
And your bags are packed, I don't wanna say goodbye
When I see the trees light up, when they hang the mistletoe
And I'm by the fire, I don't wanna be alone

[Chorus]
Baby, won't you take me home for Christmas, show me 'round your town?
Take me where you used to watch the snow come down
All of your traditions, I wanna know 'em all
You'll check every box off of my list
If you take me home for Christmas

[Post-Chorus]
Take me home, yeah
Take me home
Take me home

[Verse 2]
I wanna spend the night before drinkin' with your high school friends
'Round the neighborhood, we could do a little caroling
Watchin' Santa fly 'cross a Christmas moon
Don't need gifts this year if I got you

[Chorus]
Baby, won't you take me home for Christmas, show me 'round your town?
Take me where you used to watch the snow come down
All of your traditions, I wanna know 'em all
You'll check every box off of my list
If you take me home for Christmas

[Bridge]
Wanna be by your side
When you open your eyes and say, ""Baby, it's Christmas""
Yes, I do, ooh

[Chorus]
Baby, won't you take me home for Christmas, show me 'round your town?
Take me where you used to watch the snow come down (Snow come down)
All of your traditions (La-da-da-da-da), I wanna know 'em all (Every single one of 'em, baby)
You'll check every box off of my list
If you take me home for Christmas (Home for Christmas)

[Post-Chorus]
Take me home (Oh, yeah, babe)
Take me home (Take me home)
Take me home (Hey)

[Outro]
Dum-dum, dum-dum, dum-dum, dum-dum, da-dum-da
Da-dum
Oh, oh, da-da-da-da-da-da-da-yeah
Yeah, you know it, baby
Ooh
Oh

"I'm going to give you the lyrics of a song by ""Darius Rucker"" entitled ""Homegrown Honey"" from 2015. Here are the lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Sitting at a bar in New York City
Everybody here looking New York pretty
But you’re the kinda girl that’s got that something
Dancing to the groove like it just ain’t nothing
They ain’t never seen nothing quite like you
Long stem legs in your cowboy boots
Throwing back whiskey straight, no water
Girl there ain’t nothing hotter

[Chorus]
Ooh, I dig the way that you move
You shake it down to your roots
Did your momma teach you how to do that thing you do
Yeah, nothing sweeter than wild
I’ll take a sip of that smile
I’ll bet the boys at home can’t leave you alone
You little homegrown honey, honey, honey
You’re so money, money, money
You got a country road Carolina soul
Baby you’re just so homegrown

[Verse 2]
Trying to think of something cool to say
Turned around and saw you walking my way
Pulled me on the floor saying “Son it’s on”
And we were dancing all night long
To a sweet old Alabama song

[Chorus]
Ooh, I dig the way that you move
You shake it down to your roots
Did your momma teach you how to do that thing you do
Yeah, nothing sweeter than wild
I’ll take a sip of that smile
I’ll bet the boys at home can’t leave you alone
You little homegrown honey, honey, honey
You’re so money, money, money
You got a country road Carolina soul
Baby you’re just so homegrown

[Bridge]
Ooh baby, baby, baby
You’re driving me crazy, crazy, crazy
I’m a long way away from where I’m from
But baby you feel like home

[Chorus]
Ooh, I dig the way that you move
You shake it down to your roots
Did your momma teach you how to do that thing you do
Yeah, nothing sweeter than wild
I’ll take a sip of that smile

[Verse 1:]
Always the life of the party
Always the clown of the class
All of my friends see me happy, baby
But happy is only a mask

Nobody knows when I'm alone
Inside my room
I sing another tune

[Chorus:]
I'm going down
When I hear the sound
The sound of my tears

When you're not around
It's all I can do
When I listen to
The sound of my tears, baby
When I'm missing you

[Verse 2:]
Don't mind the sound of the city, baby
Don't mind the noise of the crowd
Just when I'm lonely
With my thoughts of you
The silence is always too loud

Pay it no mind
You know the truth
Behind the smile
It's only just a lie

"I'm going to give you the lyrics of a song by ""Dolly Parton"" entitled ""Starting Over Again"" from 1980. Here are the lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Momma moved out, Daddy sold the house
They split up the money and went on their way
And all the king's horses and all the king's men
Couldn't put Mommy and Daddy back together again

[Chorus]
Starting over again
Where should they begin?
Because they've never been out on their own
Starting over again
Where do you begin?
When your dreams are all shattered
And the kids are all grown
And the whole world cries

[Verse 2]
Got an apartment, she moved in with her sisters
He's scheming big deals with one of his friends
While she sits at home just sorting out pieces
Of left over memories from thirty odd years

[Chorus]
Starting over again
Where do you begin
You've never been out on your own
Starting over again
Never any end

[Verse 3]
What will the neighbors say?
They're talking talk
It's small town news
Facing fifty years old
Breaking up a happy home
And this far down the road
You find yourself alone
Two fools

[Chorus]
Starting over again
Now where do you begin
When you've never been out on your own
Starting over again
Never any end
When your dreams are all shattered
And the kids are all grown

And all the king's horses and all the king's men
Could never put Mommy and Daddy back together
Back together, again

[Chorus]
Here we go here we go as the tune starts to bloom
With a phat phat phat chorus
1-2-3 if this is O.G
The freaks would ya move ya booties
The getto jam is about to slam
With some notes from the diggady D-E
As I key what's really goin on
Would ya reminisce with me-e

[Verse 1: Domino]
Saturday mornin' just gettin up
With a hangover smellin' like I fucked
I really can't remember cause I'm still kinda faded
So I close my eyes and thank God that I made it
Now I'm gettin flashbacks of some O.J
With a green glass, says Tanqueray
Took it to the head, gulped it down with the quickness
Now I need a bitch so I can handle my business
What do you know, a freak's in my reach
Threw her on the flo', stuck it in her deep
She's screamin and she's screamin and she's screamin, gettin hoarse
But then I busted a nut, and that was that
So kick the chorus

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Domino]
My homies are down, chillin' in the hood
But them hood bitches, well they ain't no good
To another man well she might be some good cat
But homies in the hood label her as a hood rat
She's scandalous
So those with game can fuck
And ooh, she'll clown your ass real fast, if you're quick to nut
And when you're in that thi-ing
She'll make a nigga si-ng
Duh-du-dway, duh-dum-dway, duh-dum-dway
But you don't hear me doe
Ain't nuthin wrong with being a Trojan man, when ya ridin
So let's kick the chorus please if ya like it

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Domino]
My homie's clownin' in his dope, yellow chevy
Too O.D.'ed to be dropped
Kenwood's kickin that funk in the trunk
Clean with the rag on top, yeah
Rollin down the 'Shaw, guess what we saw, some bitches
The finest one is on my nuts, she's blowing kisses
So I approached the freak of the week
And I played it like a game of blackjack
And for all that ass that she toted around
Well I offered a backpack
And since I'm a mack
Well you know how the story goes
So all ya hoes and their bros here we go

I got all exotic bitches, you gon' think I'm racist, yeah
I just called a gang of bitches out of immigration, uh
You gon' think we printin' money 'cause the way we make it, uh
I got all these fuckin' whips and ain't got no payments

Got a gang of broads riding and they on drugs with me
Got a gang of cash on me like I brought the plug with me
Niggas looking for the plug, nigga, I'm the plug really, ayy

Really, I'm the plug, really, I'm the plug
I dropped a few whoop-da-whoops in my cup
Put it on my tab, put her on my tab
Franchise tag on me, Bron Bron
Steph Curry wrist, nigga, Oakland
Perkies for the bitch in Magic, Don Juan
Standing ovation and an encore
And I keep a check, Nike Concord

[Verse 3: Drake]
Whole time, I was ready
They was like, ""Hold up, wait a minute""
I was like, ""Nah, nigga, let's get it""
This that OVO Halloween gang, you know how I'm rocking already
If you come here tryna take somethin', there's a lot more where that came from
And it really ain't no thang, I got Summer P in this thang
I just dropped a jig in my Red Bull and it really gave me wings
Yeah, yeah, up and away
Y'all should have seen this shit comin' in May
We doing three hundred records a day
Who really think they can get in the way?
Nah, nah, niggas is bitter, they hurtin'
Look at the business mergers
Throwed back when I'm swerving (Skrrt)
Big body my Suburban
Everything I do on purpose
I'm blowin' up like it's urgent (Brrt)
And she was actin' like a virgin (Nah)
I gave it to her, then I curved her

"I'm going to give you the lyrics of a song by ""Eve"" entitled ""Satisfaction"" from 2003. Here are the lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Now I'mma do this thing like it ain't done before
Never leave the game stranded, I had to give more
I'mma give you what you want, what you waitin' for?
Make the music that the people can't ignore
A lot of niggas is bitches, a lot of bitches be trippin'
A lot of them be wishin' that they was in my position
A lot of niggas be cowards and most chicks be chickens
Fuck 'bout the CLUCK! CLUCK! Eve ain't trippin'
Most dudes is okay (half of the rest ain't)
Talkin' 'bout what they wanna do (reality they can't)
Ask 'em what they life worth, watch 'em draw a blank
I really ain't got no interest if it don't involve the bank
Most of the time I'm nice to 'em (half the time I'm not)
It ain't nothin' new though (learned it from off the block)
People think I changed much 'cuz I'm livin' good
Now they get my voicemail, hear them callin' me rude?
Sometimes I feel bad (most of the time I don't)
'Cuz if I don't protect my shit (other niggas won't)
Some want me to neglect my shit (take it for a joke?!)
But I'm stayin' on the grind (never goin' back to broke)

[Hook]
Anything I want
I'mma get it 'cuz I know I need it
It's Evey comin' and I know you heated
Anything I need
Gotta have it, bet I'm gonna grab it
Ain't nothin' better than the satisfaction
Everything I am
Just because I had to make it happen
They never thought that I would make it rappin'
Anything I need
Gotta have it, bet I'm gonna grab it
Ain't nothin' better than the satisfaction

[Verse 2]
Now I'mma do this thing like it ain't done before
Never leave the game stranded, I had to give more
I'mma give you what you want, what you waitin' for?
Make the music that the people can't ignore
See how we do this thing, dog, here we go again
Dre and Bombshell, don't you love how it blend?
Radio stations, DJ's they spin
Told y'all determined to win
You tryna enter through the back door?
Ain't nothin' happenin', this whole shit is my shit, bitch, and I'm the captain
Can't beat me, join me, baby, then get to clappin'
Bang it in ya whips to get ya neck snappin'
I know you hopin' that I rest so you can breathe
Stressed when we in the same places 'till I leave
Whisper to they friends, ""What they wanna do to me?""
Wish they could erase me, take away the air I breathe
And I feed 'cuz that shit only give me hunger pains
Never let you muhfuckas put out my flame
Ready for whatever, was trained to maintain
And I always been a savage 'bout the fame
Separate the girls from the women and the winnin'
Always knew the thrill was worth it from the beginnin'
Baby, what's the deal? I'm hurtin' 'em how I'm livin'
I gotta conquer it all now the world's my wishin'

They never thought that I would make it rappin'
Anything I need
Gotta have it, bet I'm gonna grab it
Ain't nothin' better than the satisfaction

[Bridge]
Ain't nothin' hotter than this heat y'all, it's like a magnet
I don't really mess wit too many 'cuz they be plastic
That's it enjoy it boy, it's like magic
Anything less than a banger will not have it
Still, I Ruff Ryde but I got my team
And we ain't goin' nowhere 'till we lock the game
But in the mean time, ball while we live the dream
And now I need to hear y'all sing

Anything I need
Gotta have it, bet I'm gonna grab it
Ain't nothin' better than the satisfaction

[Bridge]
Ain't nothin' hotter than this heat y'all, it's like a magnet
I don't really mess wit too many 'cuz they be plastic
That's it enjoy it boy, it's like magic
Anything less than a banger will not have it
Still, I Ruff Ryde but I got my team
And we ain't goin' nowhere 'till we lock the game
But in the mean time, ball while we live the dream
And now I need to hear y'all sing

[Hook]
Anything I want
I'mma get it 'cuz I know I need it
It's Evey comin' and I know you heated
Anything I need
Gotta have it, bet I'm gonna grab it
Ain't nothin' better than the satisfaction
Everything I am
Just because I had to make it happen
They never thought that I would make it rappin'
Anything I need
Gotta have it, bet I'm gonna grab it
Ain't nothin' better than the satisfaction

Anything I want
I'mma get it 'cuz I know I need it
It's Evey comin' and I know you heated
Anything I need
Gotta have it, bet I'm gonna grab it
Ain't nothin' better than the satisfaction
Everything I am
Just because I had to make it happen
They never thought that I would make it rappin'
Anything I need
Gotta have it, bet I'm gonna grab it

"I'm going to give you the lyrics of a song by ""Frank Zappa"" entitled ""Valley Girl"" from 1982. Here are the lyrics:

[Chorus: Frank Zappa]
Valley girl, she's a valley girl
Valley girl, she's a valley girl
Okay, fine, fer sure, fer sure
She's a valley girl in a clothing store
Okay, fine, fer sure, fer sure
She's a

[Verse 1: Moon Unit Zappa, (Frank Zappa)]
Like, oh my god! (Valley girl)
Like, totally! (Valley girl)
Encino is, like, so bitchin' (Valley girl)
There's, like, the Galleria (Valley girl)
And, like
All these, like, really great shoe stores
I, like, love going into, like, clothing stores and stuff
I, like, buy the neatest mini-skirts and stuff
It's, like, so bitchin'
'Cause, like, everybody's like super-super nice
It's, like, so bitchin'
Like

[Bridge: Frank Zappa]
On Ventura, there she goes
She just bought some bitchin' clothes
Tosses her head and flips her hair
She got a whole bunch of nothing in there

[Verse 2: Moon Unit Zappa]
Anyway
He goes ""Are you into S and M?""
I go, oh, right
Could you, like, just picture me
In a, like, a leather teddy
Yeah, right
Hurt me, hurt me
I'm sure! No way!
He was, like, freaking me out
He called me a beastie
That's 'cause, like
He was totally blitzed
He goes, like, bag your face!
I'm sure!

[Chorus: Frank Zappa]
Valley girl, she's a valley girl
Valley girl, she's a valley girl
Okay, fine, fer sure, fer sure
She's a valley girl, so sweet and pure
Okay, fine, fer sure, fer sure
She's a

[Verse 3: Moon Unit Zappa, (Frank Zappa)]
Really sad (Valley girl)
Like my English teacher
He's like (Valley girl)
He's like Mr. Bu-Fu (Valley girl)
We're talking Lord God King Bu-Fu (Valley girl)
I am so sure
He's, like, so gross
Like, he sits there and
Like, plays with all his rings
And he, like
Flirts with all the guys in the class
It's, like, totally disgusting
I'm like so sure
It's like
Barf me out
Gag me with a spoon!

[Bridge: Frank Zappa]
Last idea to cross her mind
Had something to do with where to find
A pair of jeans to fit her butt
And where to get her toenails cut

[Verse 4: Moon Unit Zappa]
So, like
I go into this, like, salon place, y'know
And I wanted, like, to get my toenails done
And the lady, like, goes
""Oh, my god, your toenails are, like, so grody""
It was, like, really embarrassing
She's like
""Oh, my God, like, bag those toenails""
I'm like, ""Sure""
She goes
""Uh, I don't know if I can handle this""
Y'know, I was like really embarrassed

[Chorus: Frank Zappa]
Valley girl, she's a valley girl
Valley girl, she's a valley girl
Okay, fine, fer sure, fer sure
She's a valley girl and there is no cure
Okay, fine, fer sure, fer sure
She's a valley girl and there is no cure

[Verse 5: Moon Unit Zappa, (Frank Zappa)]
Like, my mother is, like, a total space cadet (Valley girl)
She, like, makes me do the dishes (Valley girl)
And clean the cat box (Valley girl)
I am sure
That's, like, gross (Valley girl)
Barf out! (Valley girl)
Oh, my God! (Valley girl)
Hi! Uh-huh (Valley girl)
My name?
My name is Ondrya Wolfson (Valley girl)
Uh-huh, that's right, Ondrya (Valley girl)
Uh-huh, I know, it's like (Valley girl)
I do not talk funny, I am sure (Valley girl)
What's'a matter with the way I talk? (Valley girl)
I am a val, I know (Valley girl)
But I live in, like In a really good part of Encino
So it's okay (Valley girl, valley girl)
So, like, I don't know (Valley girl)
I'm, like, freaking out totally (Valley girl)
Oh my God! (Valley girl)
Hi, I have to go to the orthodontist (Valley girl)
I'm getting my braces off, y'know (Valley girl)
But I have to wear a retainer
That's going to be really, like, a total bummer
I'm freaking out
I'm sure
Like, those things that, like, stick in your mouth
They're so gross
You, like, get saliva all over them
But, like, I don't know
It's going to be cool, y'know
You guys might see my smile
It'll be, like, really cool
Except my, like
My teeth are, like, too small
But no biggie
It's so awesome
It's like tubular, y'know
Well, I'm not, like, really ugly or anything
It's just like
I don't know
You know me
I'm, like, into the, like, the clean stuff
Like, Pac-Man
And, like, I don't know
Like, my mother, like
Makes me do the dishes
It's, like, so gross
Like, all the stuff, like
Sticks to the plates
And it's like, it's like
Somebody else's food, y'know
It's like grody, grody to the max
I'm sure
It's, like, really nauseating
Like, barf out
Gag me with a spoon!
Gross!
I am sure!
Totally!

"I'm going to give you the lyrics of a song by ""Franz Ferdinand"" entitled ""Take Me Out"" from 2004. Here are the lyrics:

[Intro]
So if you're lonely, you know I'm here waiting for you
I'm just a cross-hair, I'm just a shot away from you
And if you leave here, you leave me broken, shattered I lie
I'm just a cross-hair, I'm just a shot, then we can die
Oh, oh, oh
I know I won't be leaving here with you

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 1]
I say, ""Don't you know?""
You say you don't know
I say, ""Take me out""
I say, ""Don't you know?""
Don't move, time is slow
I say, ""Take me out""

[Verse 2]
Well, I say, ""You don't know""
You say, ""You don't know""
I say, ""Take me out""
If I move, this could die
If eyes move, this could die
I want you to take me out

[Chorus]
I know I won't be leaving here (With you)
I know I won't be leaving here
I know I won't be leaving here (With you)
I know I won't be leaving here with you

[Verse 3]
I say, ""Don't you know?""
You say you don't know
I say, ""Take me out""
If I wane, this could die
If I wait, this could die
I want you to take me out
If I move, this could die
Eyes move, this can die
Come on, take me out

"I'm going to give you the lyrics of a song by ""Franz Ferdinand"" entitled ""Take Me Out"" from 2004. Here are the lyrics:

[Intro]
So if you're lonely, you know I'm here waiting for you
I'm just a cross-hair, I'm just a shot away from you
And if you leave here, you leave me broken, shattered I lie
I'm just a cross-hair, I'm just a shot, then we can die
Oh, oh, oh
I know I won't be leaving here with you

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 1]
I say, ""Don't you know?""
You say you don't know
I say, ""Take me out""
I say, ""Don't you know?""
Don't move, time is slow
I say, ""Take me out""

[Verse 2]
Well, I say, ""You don't know""
You say, ""You don't know""
I say, ""Take me out""
If I move, this could die
If eyes move, this could die
I want you to take me out

[Chorus]
I know I won't be leaving here (With you)
I know I won't be leaving here
I know I won't be leaving here (With you)
I know I won't be leaving here with you

[Verse 3]
I say, ""Don't you know?""
You say you don't know
I say, ""Take me out""
If I wane, this could die
If I wait, this could die
I want you to take me out
If I move, this could die
Eyes move, this can die
Come on, take me out

[Chorus]
I know I won't be leaving here (With you)
I know I won't be leaving here
I know I won't be leaving here (With you)
I know I won't be leaving here with you

Don't go away, please stay by my side
Just hold me tight
I wanna be with you tonight
Don't go away and show me your love
You bring me joy
You are the center of my life

Uuooh, uuoooh ...

I want to be your fulltime lover
And no matter where you are
I wanna be with you

Hey! Know what you say

Hey! You save my time

"I'm going to give you the lyrics of a song by ""Genius Brasil Traduções"" entitled ""Benny the Butcher & J. Cole - Johnny P’s Caddy (Tradução em Português)"" from 2022. Here are the lyrics:

[Intro: Benny the Butcher]
Yeah, tá ligado?
Tana Talk 4, essa merda significa muito pra mim, tá ligado?
Você sabe que essa merda não é tão boa quanto parece (Grande Griselda)
Eu vou ser real com você (Família Soprano Negra)
Mas eu tô bem (Eu tô bem)
Essa merda de rua me fez o que eu sou hoje
Esses caras sabem que eu cheguei tão duro por essa merda
Eu mereço essa merda, mano (Ah)
O Butcher tá chegando, mano

[Verso 1: Benny the Butcher]
Essa não é a minha história sobre trapos até as riquezas, é mais sobre como eu dominеi a física (Uh-huh)
No jogo, eu costumava treinar como o Rocky, pegando galinhas (Yеah)
Eu tava de boa, mas eles estavam certos quando me falaram que o rap é um negócio
Eu tinha dez mil no meu estoque quando ultrapassei meio milhão
Vir fácil? Não é bom, não se surpreenda que eu dure mais que esses caras
É como se eles fizessem um sucesso, depois sumissem com um flash, admita
E depois fizessem faixas e insultassem a gente como se isso fosse somar os dígitos (Que porra você tá fazendo?)
Eles mostram dinheiro falso nas fotos como se fossem atrair as vadias
Essa era realmente eu, mano, eu não preciso atuar em Conflicted (Não)
A única diferença é que eu tô vivendo e eu teria destruído um desses caras
Quem diria que depois do tráfico eu ainda estaria gastando mais alguns milhões?
Renda anual, então aqui está o meu manual e mais um pouco
E essa merda do lado Leste ainda tá comigo
Minha habilidade de transformar palavras em imagens é o motivo pelo qual eles vão se lembrar de mim (Vamos conversar)
Me imagine andar nessa corda bamba com a agilidade de um felino
As ruas fizeram tanta merda comigo, eu não consigo viver civilmente
Eu não posso sair de cena sem checar meus retrovisores
Chego com essa energia, porque alguma merda sempre vai ficar comigo
Eles querem saber o que eu trouxe pra Griselda, eu digo, ""Validade""
Eles perguntam, ""Que trabalho vocês fazem?"", Eu falo, ""O que não fizemos?""
Problemas que eu corrijo através dos obstáculos que progrido
É ilógico pra eles se sentirem responsáveis ​​pelo nosso sucesso
Além do Con' e do West, me diga quem mais eu tenho que respeitar (Quem mais?)
Porque eu tô meio perplexo, tá na hora de eu receber meu respeito
É o Butcher, mano
Ah, vamo lá

[Interlúdio: J. Cole]
Tá na hora de eu receber meu respeito, é o Butcher, mano
Yeah, o Cole tá fodendo o Mundo
Coisa da Griselda, tá ligado (Griselda)
Você sabe o que é, mano, quando eu apareço
Eu tô no dez, mano, não no nove

[Verso 2: J. Cole]
Na noite em que eu nasci, a chuva tava caindo, Deus tava chorando
O raio caiu, acabou a energia, as faíscas estavam voando
O de verdade tá aqui, o garoto que anda com leões
Ao redor dos contornos do giz onde os cadáveres estão
É claro que eu tô tentando reviver um esporte que tá morrendo
Mas as armas e as rimas sobre drogas em que vocês confiam
Deixam esses nerds pensando que esses caras são fodas como eu
Mas isso só significa que eu não tô tão confortável enquanto vocês estão mentindo
Esticando a verdade, não, eu nunca me estresso no estúdio
Eles sentem a pressão, eu sinto que acabei de sair da massagista
Sem esforço, como eu tô patinando nessas músicas foi a prova
Eu coloquei o pescoço do seu rapper favorito numa corda, nunca deixei eles soltos
Cold World, o grave tá explodindo no seu alto-falante
Ele é o último dos Moicanos, nenhum fracote dura no meus tênis
O cara quer eu numa música, ele vai ver a ira do ceifador
Eu provavelmente vou pro inferno se Jesus pedir por uma participação
Eu sou mais alto que os caras e não preciso de um saco cheio de maconha
Alguns vêem o copo vazio, eu vejo um copo cheio de éter
Coletando sua grana na missa como se fosse um pregador católico
Só pra contar o dinheiro de um cara, você pode precisar de um professor de cálculo
Eureka, Einstein à beira da teoria da relatividade
Realmente não existe nenhum MC igual, me entende?
O Cole com a caneta é letal, minha casa parece com uma daquele programa antigo da MTV, uh
Por Deus, o melhor rapper vivo
Tiro na cabeça, agora vai perguntar pros melhores rappers que morreram
Eles vão dizer que ele nunca mentiu, mano

Minha habilidade de transformar palavras em imagens é o motivo pelo qual eles vão se lembrar de mim (Vamos conversar)
Me imagine andar nessa corda bamba com a agilidade de um felino
As ruas fizeram tanta merda comigo, eu não consigo viver civilmente
Eu não posso sair de cena sem checar meus retrovisores
Chego com essa energia, porque alguma merda sempre vai ficar comigo
Eles querem saber o que eu trouxe pra Griselda, eu digo, ""Validade""
Eles perguntam, ""Que trabalho vocês fazem?"", Eu falo, ""O que não fizemos?""
Problemas que eu corrijo através dos obstáculos que progrido
É ilógico pra eles se sentirem responsáveis ​​pelo nosso sucesso
Além do Con' e do West, me diga quem mais eu tenho que respeitar (Quem mais?)
Porque eu tô meio perplexo, tá na hora de eu receber meu respeito
É o Butcher, mano
Ah, vamo lá

[Interlúdio: J. Cole]
Tá na hora de eu receber meu respeito, é o Butcher, mano
Yeah, o Cole tá fodendo o Mundo
Coisa da Griselda, tá ligado (Griselda)
Você sabe o que é, mano, quando eu apareço
Eu tô no dez, mano, não no nove

[Verso 2: J. Cole]
Na noite em que eu nasci, a chuva tava caindo, Deus tava chorando
O raio caiu, acabou a energia, as faíscas estavam voando
O de verdade tá aqui, o garoto que anda com leões
Ao redor dos contornos do giz onde os cadáveres estão
É claro que eu tô tentando reviver um esporte que tá morrendo
Mas as armas e as rimas sobre drogas em que vocês confiam
Deixam esses nerds pensando que esses caras são fodas como eu
Mas isso só significa que eu não tô tão confortável enquanto vocês estão mentindo
Esticando a verdade, não, eu nunca me estresso no estúdio
Eles sentem a pressão, eu sinto que acabei de sair da massagista
Sem esforço, como eu tô patinando nessas músicas foi a prova
Eu coloquei o pescoço do seu rapper favorito numa corda, nunca deixei eles soltos
Cold World, o grave tá explodindo no seu alto-falante
Ele é o último dos Moicanos, nenhum fracote dura no meus tênis
O cara quer eu numa música, ele vai ver a ira do ceifador
Eu provavelmente vou pro inferno se Jesus pedir por uma participação
Eu sou mais alto que os caras e não preciso de um saco cheio de maconha
Alguns vêem o copo vazio, eu vejo um copo cheio de éter
Coletando sua grana na missa como se fosse um pregador católico
Só pra contar o dinheiro de um cara, você pode precisar de um professor de cálculo
Eureka, Einstein à beira da teoria da relatividade
Realmente não existe nenhum MC igual, me entende?
O Cole com a caneta é letal, minha casa parece com uma daquele programa antigo da MTV, uh
Por Deus, o melhor rapper vivo
Tiro na cabeça, agora vai perguntar pros melhores rappers que morreram
Eles vão dizer que ele nunca mentiu, mano

[Ritornello: Bailey Zimmerman]
Dove vado da qua?
Perché piccola sto andando velocemente da nessuna parte
Perché metà di me è scomparsa
Quando quelle luci di coda non si sono girate indietro
Ora sono perso nella memoria
Perso nel blu
Perso nelle lenzuola in un letto fatto per due
Dove vado da qua?
Perché non sono mai stato perso finché ho perso te

[Strofa 1: Bailey Zimmerman]
Stesse strade
Stesse luci
Stesse persone in un bar nella notte di un sabato
Stessa luna
Stello cielo
Ma sono qui guardando intorno tipo, ""Dove sono?""

[Pre-Ritornello: Bailey Zimmerman]
La mia mente sta girando fuori controllo
Non riesco a dormire quando sto dormendo solo
Sto sveglio tutta notte solo controllando il mio telefono
Sapendo che non stai tornando a casa

[Strofa 2: The Kid LAROI]
Ragazza mi hai avuto preso dai tuoi amici
Ed anche la tua famiglia si è avvicinata
Dimmi, a chi non dovrei parlare?
In tutti i miei piani futuri, eravamo noi due
Vorrei aver saputo nei tuoi ci fossi solo tu
Avrei dovuto leggere i segnali
Visti troppe volte
E guardando indietro, so ora perché dicono che l'amore è cieco
Immagino tu non possa vincere un gioco che non stai di star giocando
Ora che è arrivato a una fine tutto ciò che posso dire è

[Verse 1]
It's been so long, girl, since I've felt this way
So many times you stole my heart away
Before I say the things I want to say
I need to know that you will be the one for, one for me
I'd like to know how far this love will go
I want to be the one who's glad to know
That this won't only be a memory
Just tell me what you see, just what this love can be

[Chorus]
Just look into my eyes
And tell me what you see
Promises were broken
Now it's you, girl, that I need
Just look into my eyes
You'll see a rainbow we can share
Please don't let this be another lie
Just look into my eyes
Just look into my eyes

[Verse 2]
As I count the hours of the day
Just tell me what I need to hear you say
I want to play those games I used to play
Baby, can't you see just what you do to, do to me?
It's hard enough to find a love that's true
How heaven knows, girl, I wanted to be with you
Some other times I've left it up to you
Just open up your heart and, girl, just turn the key

[Chorus]
Just look into my eyes
And tell me what you see
Promises were broken
Now it's you, girl, that I need
Just look into my eyes
You'll see a rainbow we can share

Just take my hand and show me what this means to you
A special love where all our dreams come true
Just look into my eyes and share this dream, just me and you

"I'm going to give you the lyrics of a song by ""Greg Lake"" entitled ""Let Me Love You Once"" from 1982. Here are the lyrics:

[Verse 1]
When there's something I can't have, I only want it more
You know I sure found out the hard way that it's true
'Cause there's a storm inside of me from wantin' you
How I wish that I'd found you in time
'Cause now you're his and can't be mine

[Verse 2]
But you can start a fire raging just by touching me
Even though I know we're not supposed to touch
Oh, I've never wanted anyone so much
How I wish that I had found you first
Can't you see my heart's about to burst?

[Chorus]
So let me love you once before you go
Your eyes keep saying yes to me, so don't keep saying no
Let me love you once and then you'll see
No one's ever gonna love you more than me

[Verse 3]
Let me lock the door and open all my love to you
All the love I've longed to give you since we met
It's the only chance I'm ever gonna get
And I just can't let it disappear
Oh my darling, please come over here

[Chorus]
And let me love you once before you go
Your eyes keep saying yes to me, so don't keep saying no
Let me love you once and then you'll see
No one's ever gonna love you more than me

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 4]
Let me lock the door and open all my love to you

And I just can't let it disappear
Oh my darling, please come over here

Let me love you once and then you'll see

When there's something I can't have, I only want it more
You know I sure found out the hard way that it's true
'Cause there's a storm inside of me from wantin' you
How I wish that I'd found you in time
'Cause now you're his and can't be mine

[Verse 2]
But you can start a fire raging just by touching me
Even though I know we're not supposed to touch
Oh, I've never wanted anyone so much
How I wish that I had found you first
Can't you see my heart's about to burst?

So let me love you once before you go
Your eyes keep saying yes to me, so don't keep saying no
Let me love you once and then you'll see
No one's ever gonna love you more than me

Let me lock the door and open all my love to you
All the love I've longed to give you since we met
It's the only chance I'm ever gonna get
And I just can't let it disappear
Oh my darling, please come over here

You must remember this
A kiss is still a kiss
A sigh is just a sigh
The fundamental things apply as time goes by
And when two lovers woo
They still say ""I love you""

Mmm, mmm, mmm
Ooh, whoa-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
You were looking so good to me
The night we met, I could not see
How deep you were to penetrate my heart, mmm
Now that some time has passed
It made me think this was meant to last
I never wanna be apart, oh no, no
Don't let me fool you if I'm acting kinda cold to you
It's just a little game I like to play
'Cause when we're together, it just keeps getting better
If I had my way

[Intro]
For the Anaheim, Azusa, and Cucamonga Sewing Circle, Book Review and Timing Association

[Verse 1]
They wear organdy dresses and high-button shoes
They read Playboy magazine and Hot-Rod News
There's Patience Proper and Prudence Prim
You oughta see 'em do the swim

[Chorus]
They come from Anaheim, Azusa, and Cucamonga too
For a sewing circle and book review
The little old ladies wait in wild anticipation
For the meetings of the double-A-C A-S-S-N

[Post-Chorus]
For the Anaheim, Azusa, and Cucamonga Sewing Circle, Book Review and Timing Association

[Verse 2]
They toot around town in their big Grand Prixes
Sittin' in their bucket seats, shootin' the breeze
You know that all week long they put up jammin' preserves
But on the weekends, they negotiate curves

[Chorus]
They come from Anaheim, Azusa, and Cucamonga too
For a sewing circle and the book review
The little old ladies wait in wild anticipation
For the meetings of the double-A-C A-S-S-N

[Post-Chorus]
For the Anaheim, Azusa, and Cucamonga Sewing Circle, Book Review and Timing Association

[Verse 3]
The meeting breaks up with a thunderous roar
Then there's a mad, mad rush for the big oak door
They run to their cars like the start at LeMans
Then they go spinnin' donuts in the lawns

They come from Anaheim, Azusa, and Cucamonga too

[Verse 1]
Busted flat in Baton Rouge, waitin' for a train
When I was feelin' near as faded as my jeans
Bobby thumbed a diesel down, just before it rained
That rode us all the way in to New Orleans
I pulled my harpoon out of my dirty red bandana
I was playin' soft while Bobby sang the blues, yeah
Windshield wipers slappin' time, I was holdin' Bobby's hand in mine
We sang every song that driver knew

[Chorus]
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin', don't mean nothin', honey, if it ain't free, no no
Yeah, feelin' good was easy, Lord, when he sang the blues
You know feelin' good was good enough for me
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee

[Verse 2]
From the Kentucky coal mine to the California sun
Yeah, Bobby shared the secrets of my soul
Through all kinds of weather, through everything we done
Yeah, Bobby baby kept me from the cold
One day up near Salinas, Lord, I let him slip away
He's lookin' for that home, and I hope he finds it
But I'd trade all of my tomorrows for one single yesterday
To be holdin' Bobby's body next to mine

[Chorus]
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose
Nothin', and that's all that Bobby left me
Well feelin' good was easy, Lord, when he sang the blues

"I'm going to give you the lyrics of a song by ""John Lennon"" entitled ""Nobody Told Me"" from 1984. Here are the lyrics:

[Intro]
Three, four!

[Verse 1]
Well, everybody's talking, and no one says a word
Everybody's making love, and no one really cares
There's Nazis in the bathroom just below the stairs
Always something happening and nothing going on
There's always something cooking and nothing in the pot
They're starving back in China, so finish what you've got

[Chorus]
Nobody told me there'd be days like these
Nobody told me there'd be days like these
Nobody told me there'd be days like these
Strange days indeed
Strange days indeed

[Verse 2]
Everybody's running, and no one makes a move
Well, everybody's a winner and nothing left to lose
There's a little yellow idol to the north of Kathmandu
Everybody's flying, and no one leaves the ground
Well, everybody's crying, and no one makes a sound
There's a place for us in movies, you just gotta lay around

[Chorus]
Nobody told me there'd be days like these
Nobody told me there'd be days like these
Nobody told me there'd be days like these
Strange days indeed
Most peculiar, mama

[Verse 3]
Everybody's smoking, and no one's getting high
Everybody's flying and never touch the sky
There's UFOs over New York, and I ain't too surprised

[Chorus]
Nobody told me there'd be days like these
Nobody told me there'd be days like these
Nobody told me there'd be days like these
Strange days indeed
Most peculiar, mama, roll!

[Verse 1]
Well, everybody's talking, and no one says a word
Everybody's making love, and no one really cares
There's Nazis in the bathroom just below the stairs
Always something happening and nothing going on
There's always something cooking and nothing in the pot
They're starving back in China, so finish what you've got

[Chorus]
Nobody told me there'd be days like these
Nobody told me there'd be days like these
Nobody told me there'd be days like these
Strange days indeed
Strange days indeed

[Verse 2]
Everybody's running, and no one makes a move
Well, everybody's a winner and nothing left to lose
There's a little yellow idol to the north of Kathmandu
Everybody's flying, and no one leaves the ground
Well, everybody's crying, and no one makes a sound
There's a place for us in movies, you just gotta lay around

[Chorus]
Nobody told me there'd be days like these
Nobody told me there'd be days like these
Nobody told me there'd be days like these
Strange days indeed
Most peculiar, mama

[Verse 3]
Everybody's smoking, and no one's getting high
Everybody's flying and never touch the sky
There's UFOs over New York, and I ain't too surprised

Kiss me
I love the way
That you kiss me
There's only one thing wrong
With the way that you kiss me
Kiss me, yeah!
Now, your kisses
Are sweeter than sugar
And plenty strong enough
But, the bad part is you don't
Kiss me long enough, oh!

If I let you know too soon
Know too soon

Is you just let go too soon

I wanna tell you lies so your heart won't break
Yeah, I know, yeah, I know that I made my fair share of mistakes

Workin' up the nerve and the words to say

"I'm going to give you the lyrics of a song by ""Keith Urban"" entitled ""Wild Hearts"" from 2022. Here are the lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Saw the man in black, spotlight in the air
Heard a thousand screams, I saw my daddy stare
Feel like I've been runnin' since the day that I was born
Eagle on my back, phoenix on my arm

[Chorus]
This goes out to the drifters
And all of the dreamers ready to fly
All those born to be rockstars
Lifting their guitars and painting the sky
Can you hear me?
All of you lost ones who aren't really lost ones
Keep shining your light
This goes out to the wildcards and all of the wild hearts
Just like mine

[Verse 2]
Now listen
Has anyone ever told you, you'll never amount to anything?
You're just wastin' your time chasin' the tail of a dragon kind of dream
But I'm here to tell you anything can happen in this life
If you got that heart and the passion and a God lit fire inside

[Chorus]
This goes out to the drifters
And all of the dreamers ready to fly
All those born to be rockstars

"I'm going to give you the lyrics of a song by ""KISS"" entitled ""Forever"" from 1990. Here are the lyrics:

[Verse 1]
I gotta tell you what I'm feeling inside
I could lie to myself, but it's true
There's no denying when I look in your eyes
Girl, I'm out of my head over you

I lived so long believing all love is blind
But everything about you is tellin' me this time

[Chorus]
It's forever
This time I know and there's no doubt in my mind
Forever
Until my life is through
Girl, I'll be loving you forever

[Verse 2]
I hear the echo of a promise I made
When you're strong, you can stand on your own
Those words grow distant as I look at your face
No, I don't want to go it alone

I never thought I'd lay my heart on the line
But everything about you is telling me this time

[Chorus]
It's forever
This time I know and there's no doubt in my mind
Forever
Until my life is through
Girl, I'll be loving you forever

Yeah
[Guitar solo]

[Bridge]
Oh, I see my future when I look in your eyes
It took your love to make my heart come alive
'Cause I lived my life believing all love is blind
But everything about you is telling me this time

[Chorus]
It's forever
This time I know and there's no doubt in my mind
Forever
Until my life is through
Girl, I'll be loving you forever

Until my life is through

I gotta tell you what I'm feeling inside
I could lie to myself, but it's true
There's no denying when I look in your eyes
Girl, I'm out of my head over you

I lived so long believing all love is blind
But everything about you is tellin' me this time

It's forever
This time I know and there's no doubt in my mind
Forever
Until my life is through
Girl, I'll be loving you forever

I hear the echo of a promise I made
When you're strong, you can stand on your own
Those words grow distant as I look at your face
No, I don't want to go it alone

I never thought I'd lay my heart on the line
But everything about you is telling me this time

[Verse 1]
Red leaves on the river
Footprints in the sand
Cold walk in December
Warming up your hands
Sun dress on the front steps
Sun up by the lake
Blanket down in the backyard
Lying wide awake

[Chorus]
That's a memory I don't mess with
The girl I was the best with
The one I was obsessed with
Girl, you just don't get it
I'd fall right back with one slip
Always leaves me helpless
Don't hate me, I can't help it
Gotta leave us where we left it
You're a memory I don't mess with

[Verse 2]
Moonlight on the back seat
A breeze through the wires
Springsteen on the speakers
Girl, I'm on fire
That's stuff I don't think about
'Cause it still kills me now
I still can't dance around

[Chorus]
That memory I don't mess with
The girl I was the best with
The one I was obsessed with
Girl, you just don't get it

[Intro]
Ain't that just the way that life goes
Down down down down
Movin' way too fast or much too slow
Oohh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

[Verse 1]
He was a very special warm and gentle person
Who put in music in the world and spoken in rhyme
And it hurts me that I never really knew him
'Cause all it would have taken was some time
You know he always seems to be there when I stumbled
And when mountains got too steep for me to climb
And it tears me up to think I never touched him
'Cause all it would have taken was some time
Woah, woah, woah, ohh, yeah-yeah

[Chorus]
Ain't that just the way that life goes
Down, down, down, down
Movin' way too fast or much too slow
I'm gettin' up, gettin' high, gettin' down
Gettin' no, no, nowhere
But not gettin' into someone I should know

[Verse 2]
Now he's in another place and I can't reach him
And I feel as though I'm guilty of a crime
I took all he had to give and gave him nothin'
And all it would have taken was some time
Ohh, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Ain't that just the way that life goes
Down, down, down, down
Movin' way too fast or much too slow
I'm gettin' up, gettin' high, gettin' down

But not gettin' into someone I should know

[Intro]
Ain't that just the way that life goes
Down down down down
Movin' way too fast or much too slow
Oohh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

[Verse 1]
He was a very special warm and gentle person
Who put in music in the world and spoken in rhyme
And it hurts me that I never really knew him
'Cause all it would have taken was some time
You know he always seems to be there when I stumbled
And when mountains got too steep for me to climb
And it tears me up to think I never touched him
'Cause all it would have taken was some time
Woah, woah, woah, ohh, yeah-yeah

"I'm going to give you the lyrics of a song by ""Marc Cohn"" entitled ""True Companion"" from 1991. Here are the lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Baby I've been searching like everybody else
Can't say nothing different about myself
Sometimes I'm an angel and sometimes I'm cruel
But when it comes to love I'm just another fool
Yes I'll climb a mountain
I'm gonna swim the sea
There ain't no act of God, girl
Could keep you safe from me
My arms are reaching out
Out across this canyon
I'm asking you to be my true companion
True companion
True companion

[Verse 2]
So don't you dare and try to walk away
I've got my heart set on our wedding day
I've got this vision of a girl in white
Made my decision that it's you alright
When I take your hand
I'll watch my heart set sail
I'll take my trembling fingers
And I'll lift up your veil
Then I'll take you home
And with wild abandon
Make love to you just like a true companion
You are my true companion
I got a true companion
Whoa, a true companion

[Verse 3]
When the years have done irreparable harm
I can see us walking slowly arm in arm
Just like that couple on the corner do
'Cause girl I will always be in love with you
When I look in your eyes
I'll still see that spark
Until the shadows fall
Until the room grows dark
Then when I leave this Earth
I'll be with the angels standin'
I'll be out there waiting for my true companion
Just for my true companion

"I'm going to give you the lyrics of a song by ""Marian Hill"" entitled ""Down"" from 2017. Here are the lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Didn't even really wanna go
But if you get me out, you get a show
There's so many bodies on the floor
So baby we should go and add some more
Are you down, d-d-down, d-d-down, d-d-down, down, down?
Down, d-d-down, d-d-down, d-d-down, down, down?
Everywhere I look are peoples' hands
Thrown up in the air to help them dance
Come on, baby, catch me if you can
I know you don't have any other plans
Are you down, d-d-down, d-d-down, d-d-down, down, down?
Down, d-d-down, d-d-down, d-d-down, down, down?

Are you... down, down, d-down, down?
Down, down, d-d-down, down, d-down, down?
Are you down, are you down, are you d-d-down?
Down, down, d-d-down, down, d-down, down?
Are you down, are you down, are you d-d-d-d-down, are you Down, are you down, are you d-d-down, are you?
Down, down, d-d-down, down, d-down, down?
Down, down, down, d-d-d-down?

[Verse 2]
You know we could put them all to shame
Now isn't the time to play it safe
Isn't this the reason why you came?
So, baby, don't you let it go to waste
Are you down, d-d-down, d-d-down, d-d-down, down, down?
Down, d-d-down, d-d-down, d-d-down, down, down?
Every single thing is feeling right
Started as a quiet Friday night
I don't really think that we should fight this
What if we don't stop until it's light?
Are you down, d-d-down, d-d-down, d-d-down, down, down?
Are you down, d-d-down, d-d-down, d-d-down, down, down?

"I'm going to give you the lyrics of a song by ""Megan Thee Stallion"" entitled ""Her"" from 2022. Here are the lyrics:

[Intro]
I don't care if these bitches don't like me
'Cause, like, I'm pretty as fuck

[Verse 1]
Just the other day, I heard a ho say
Matter of fact, what could a ho say?
With a face like this and a bitch this paid
Shit, what could a ho say?
The bag so expensive, my pussy came with it
Body so nice, they be sayin', ""Who did it?""
But everything natural, actual, factual
Prissy in the streets, but I fuck like an animal
All you hoes know who the fuck I am
From your boyfriend down to my Instagram
To all them busted-ass hoes that you kiki with
I bet your jaw drop if you ever see me, bitch

[Chorus]
I'm her, her, her, her, her, her, her, her
She, she, she, she, she, she, she
Take a pic, it's me, me, me, me, me, me, me
Tell your friends this her, her, her, her, her, her, her, her (Ah)

[Verse 2]
Bitch, you do you and whatever that is, I'ma do it better
Hoes must've just seen me and they playin' catch-up
Bitches lookin' like lil' Megans playin' dress-up
Would I ever spin the block on a nigga? Never
I don't even wear an outfit twice, dead 'em
Any bitch got a problem? Probably never met 'em
Tell a hater kiss both cheeks, ciao, bella
But I'm used to the chatter 'cause

[Chorus]
I'm her, her, her, her, her, her, her, her
She, she, she, she, she, she, she
Take a pic, it's me, me, me, me, me, me, me
Tell your friends this her, her, her, her, her, her, her, her (Ah)

[Verse 3]
All this hate givin' me a pretty face
I eat hate, that's why I ain't got a waist
The more hoes hatin', more money I'ma make
And the more niggas talk, more niggas want a taste
'Cause I'm the most sickenin', hoes so fuckin' sick of me
No matter what they do or say, it ain't no gettin' rid of me
I come in every room and draw attention like a centerpiece
Steppin' for a long time, movin' like a centipede
I ain't scared of shit, man or a bitch
To everybody hatin', y'all can suck this clit
'Cause the hate campaign ain't workin' at all
I ain't Jack or Jill, bitch, I ain't gon' fall

[Chorus]
I'm her, her, her, her, her, her, her, her
She, she, she, she, she, she, she
Take a pic, it's me, me, me, me, me, me, me
Tell your friends this her, her, her, her, her, her, her, her (Ah)

"I'm going to give you the lyrics of a song by ""Morgan Wallen"" entitled ""I Got Better"" from 2025. Here are the lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Everything's still pretty much the same 'round here
Neighbors still shootin' all of next year's deer
Boys still lose 'less they're playin' at home
But I got better since you got gone
I'm still a few too many on a Friday night
I still try to step in when it ain't my fight
I'm still me, don't get me wrong
But I got better since you got gone

[Chorus]
Swear it was like, ""I'll be damned""
I'm finally back to bein' who I am
When we were over, it was overnight
Light came on, it all felt right, when it all went wrong
You turned me loose
Wasn't no tellin' who I'd turn into
But it turns out me and you together's why it took so long
'Cause I got better since you got gone

[Verse 2]
For a little while there, you had me convinced
That my mama was the devil, now we're talkin' again
My friends you hated ain't said one word
Besides, ""You got better since you lost her""

[Chorus]
Swear it was like, ""I'll be damned""
I'm finally back to bein' who I am
When we were over, it was overnight
Light came on, it all felt right, when it all went wrong
You turned me loose
Wasn't no tellin' who I'd turn into
But it turns out me and you together's why it took so long
'Cause I got better since you got gone
Oh, baby, since you got gone

[Bridge]
And I ain't sayin' you're the sleep that I lost
But I never slept this good before
I ain't sayin' you're the weight on my back
I'm just sayin' that it ain't there no more

[Chorus]
I'll be damned
I'm finally back to bein' who I am
When we were over, it was overnight
Light came on, it all felt right, when it all went wrong
You turned me loose
Wasn't no tellin' who I'd turn into
But it turns out me and you together's why it took so long

'Cause I got better since you got gone
Oh, baby, since you got gone

And I ain't sayin' you're the sleep that I lost
But I never slept this good before
I ain't sayin' you're the weight on my back
I'm just sayin' that it ain't there no more

[Verse 1]
Everything's still pretty much the same 'round here
Neighbors still shootin' all of next year's deer
Boys still lose 'less they're playin' at home
But I got better since you got gone
I'm still a few too many on a Friday night
I still try to step in when it ain't my fight
I'm still me, don't get me wrong

'Cause I got better since you got gone

That my mama was the devil, now we're talkin' again

"I'm going to give you the lyrics of a song by ""Mýa"" entitled ""The Best Of Me"" from 2000. Here are the lyrics:

[Intro: Jadakiss, Mýa (Jadakiss)]
Uh, huh
I don't wanna get the best of you, ha-ha
Yo, yo
Woah, put it on me
I can't let (Nah, yeah)
Let him go no (I just wanna do what's best for you)
Can't let you get, oh no (Yo, yo)

[Verse 1: Mýa]
He has a little game that he plays
Clever little ways and a hot boy style
Brags about the dough that he makes
Flash a little cash most girls wild out (Oh no)
Lately he's been checking for me
Telling me how much he wants to be
Wants to be the one to replace
Replace the man that waits at home for me

[B-Section: Mýa]
But oh no I can't let you
Get the best of me
Even though deep inside
Something's dying to see
How you flow out them clothes
And you put it on me

[Chorus]
Feelings coming on strong
We know that it's wrong
I can't let you get the best of me
(You put it on me)
The best of me
(You put it on me)

[Verse 2: Mýa]
So is he trying to play with my head?
Tellin' me how he could blow my mind
Somethin' 'bout the things that he said
Made me want to take it there one time
I should be walking away
Cause his hand's up on my thigh
Should I leave, should I stay?
After all it's just one night

[B-Section: Mýa]
But oh no I can't let you
Get the best of me
Even though deep inside
Something's dying to see
How you flow out them clothes
And you put it on me

[Chorus (Jadakiss)]
Feelings coming on strong
We know that it's wrong
I can't let you get the best of me
(You put it on me)
The best of me
(You put it on me, Yo, yo, yo)

[Verse 3: Jadakiss (Mýa)]
I got so many bags of money that they won't fit in the bank
And I'mma do this just like Tony did it to Frank
But I'mma make sure both y'all win
Let him keep the place, you move and I'mma pay both y'all rent
So forget about the condo and come to the crib
Cause the castle over the mountain come with a bridge
You know, literally, we could go shopping in Italy
Hand on her thigh she ain't wanna get rid of me
And she don't drink or know how a L look (Put it on me)
Channel look, mixed with the Pete Arnell look
You just stay pretty while I'm running the city (Put it on me)
When I whip the V you can hold the joint if you with me
Vacation cost a hundred and fifty, we livin' it up
I put it on your ass if you're givin' it up
And you know I'm not a hater
And if you feel bad then you call him up later
And tell him you all Jada's

[B-Section: Mýa]
But oh no I can't let you (Oh no)
Get the best of me
Even though deep inside (I can't let you)
Something's dying to see (No)
How you flow out them clothes
And you put it on me

You ain't gonna get to me
You can't get the best of me

You ain't a hater? Can't tell
Either wish me well, go to hell, or go to Yale
Study human behavior so that you know who the hell
You dealin' with, ain't nutty, but the study gon' unveil
My relative in jail – ha! Stay engaged
To whatever make money, now he married to that cage
Divorce is not an option and prenuptial is void
Eat up whatever rapper, but I'm tangled in my cord (Hum)
Bored, kind of like a knight with the sword
Without dragon to battle, so I'm running from a shadow
An impossible feat and I repeat
An impossible feat and I repeat
An impossible feat and I repeat!
The damsels in distress, but they a mess
They only like my armor, and that I'm a performer
They read one magazine and wanna think they gettin' warmer
They only gettin' colder, hell, maybe I should throw
A double Diamond party in the North Pole
Invite all the writers and journalists
Even biters will tournament, to see who can be me
Better than me, it's a permanent, smile on my face
Because you said you don't like my style
But that's okay, but just make sure you don't touch that dial
And we'll be cool, touch it and you's a fool
Look, I'll get you hooked, y'all crooks might even move
To Atlanta, Georgia, get a wife and daughter
Start a new life, and all that wrong you do, you'll make it right
But, hell, all a dream, I wear the crown, I'm king
Respect is mandatory, end of the story, go fly a kite
Category – ain't got none, you know I'm right

[Chorus: André 3000]

Congratulations, I'm a player
I thought you were one too, but now I hear you loud and clear
Subliminal, criminal minded nigga, so be aware
Black dog broke out the pits and told yo' ass it's 'bout to tear
Intended for anyone fillin' out this application
An estimate is needed for your underestimation
I'm firin' on the spot, go back and check your calculations
Like a sniper in the bushes with that rifle, I've been patiently waitin'
Now that's a virtue – 'cause, pussy nigga, I'll hurt you
Like the president's approval rating by servin' yo' ass with words, fool
Slam yo' back to the curb, bruh, a sanitation worker
'Cause you're trash, I'm taking out the trash and all trash
Get mashed and compacted, because it's no longer valid
Go 'head – recycle, repackage, then put it back in my cabinet
Boy, that's germs, I'm fresh up out the store every time
That nigga the B-I-G go hard every rhyme
Crowns all around, I'm right after Martin Luther
No J-R-period, senior, 'cause Bamboo is Antwan Junior
Dungeon Family and biological's intact
Talk bad about the fam, catch diabolical attack
No gats or no raps, you get slapped about that
As a matter of fact, not fiction, Rumpelstiltskin, you wack
Decipher words just like the Code of Da Vinci
Don't go against me, Cain, I want you to go out there
Kill them marks and come back, is you with me?
Mighty-ighty-ighty-ighty-ighty-ighty O
The worse thing since crack cocaine distributed to the poor
By the government–oh, I meant, don't nobody know
Conspiracy theory, you be the judge, nobody's slow

You ain't a hater? Can't tell
Either wish me well, go to hell, or go to Yale
Study human behavior so that you know who the hell
You dealin' with, ain't nutty, but the study gon' unveil
My relative in jail – ha! Stay engaged
To whatever make money, now he married to that cage
Divorce is not an option and prenuptial is void
Eat up whatever rapper, but I'm tangled in my cord (Hum)
Bored, kind of like a knight with the sword
Without dragon to battle, so I'm running from a shadow
An impossible feat and I repeat
An impossible feat and I repeat
An impossible feat and I repeat!
The damsels in distress, but they a mess
They only like my armor, and that I'm a performer
They read one magazine and wanna think they gettin' warmer
They only gettin' colder, hell, maybe I should throw
A double Diamond party in the North Pole
Invite all the writers and journalists
Even biters will tournament, to see who can be me
Better than me, it's a permanent, smile on my face
Because you said you don't like my style
But that's okay, but just make sure you don't touch that dial
And we'll be cool, touch it and you's a fool
Look, I'll get you hooked, y'all crooks might even move
To Atlanta, Georgia, get a wife and daughter
Start a new life, and all that wrong you do, you'll make it right
But, hell, all a dream, I wear the crown, I'm king
Respect is mandatory, end of the story, go fly a kite
Category – ain't got none, you know I'm right

Congratulations, I'm a player
I thought you were one too, but now I hear you loud and clear
Subliminal, criminal minded nigga, so be aware
Black dog broke out the pits and told yo' ass it's 'bout to tear
Intended for anyone fillin' out this application
An estimate is needed for your underestimation
I'm firin' on the spot, go back and check your calculations
Like a sniper in the bushes with that rifle, I've been patiently waitin'
Now that's a virtue – 'cause, pussy nigga, I'll hurt you
Like the president's approval rating by servin' yo' ass with words, fool
Slam yo' back to the curb, bruh, a sanitation worker
'Cause you're trash, I'm taking out the trash and all trash
Get mashed and compacted, because it's no longer valid
Go 'head – recycle, repackage, then put it back in my cabinet
Boy, that's germs, I'm fresh up out the store every time
That nigga the B-I-G go hard every rhyme
Crowns all around, I'm right after Martin Luther
No J-R-period, senior, 'cause Bamboo is Antwan Junior
Dungeon Family and biological's intact
Talk bad about the fam, catch diabolical attack
No gats or no raps, you get slapped about that
As a matter of fact, not fiction, Rumpelstiltskin, you wack
Decipher words just like the Code of Da Vinci
Don't go against me, Cain, I want you to go out there

Hot thing, tell them you're going to the Crystal Ball

"I'm going to give you the lyrics of a song by ""R. Kelly"" entitled ""Playa’s Only"" from 2005. Here are the lyrics:

[Intro: R. Kelly & The Game]
I hope y'all got y'all playa's cards
'Cause y'all ain't gettin' in unless you do
Bounce, it's the new 12-play
Bounce (Game, yo) Throw the pussy like Elway
Bounce (C'mon) I wanna see your tail shake
Bounce, when you hear R. Kellz say

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
Playa's only
We where them chicks be jerkin' they bodies
Up in the club where they get real naughty
Take 'em from here to the private party
Where there ain't nothin' but
Playa's only
Where the playas be spendin' a lot of dough
Honeys got ass bouncin' on the floor
This is how we do behind the playa's door

[Verse 1: R. Kelly]
(She on the floor) Surrounded by them playas and thugs
(She on the floor) The girls goin' wild in the club
(In V.I.P.) Got 'dro with a bottle of bub
(She don't care) Shakin' ass, just throwin' 'em up
I'd really like to know her
The way she runs her
Body up and down, she got me heated up
I can't front, I really wanna beat it up
Show her how I hit the bar and spend it up
You ain't gotta be worried 'bout being alone
'Cause tonight we'll be together in my home
Exit out the club, bouncin' our domes
Got that red coupe matchin' the chrome
Put that body in motion, motion
And watch it wave like a ocean, ocean
Now break it down and worm it, worm it
Now bring it up, now shake it, shake it

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
Playa's only
We where them chicks be jerkin' they bodies
Up in the club where they get real naughty
Take 'em from here to the private party
Where there ain't nothin' but
Playa's only
Where the playas be spendin' a lot of dough
Honeys got ass bouncin' on the floor
This is how we do behind the playa's door

[Verse 2: The Game]
I'm still fresh like, uhh, Impala, uhh
Dre's young gun still ridin' the bass drum
Four times platinum, Hate It Or Love It, I'm still number one
Still in the hood, one hand on my gun
And my trigger finger still make bitches come
I mean the one with the ring in the tongue
Compton, R. Kelly found her in the slumps
Shaking that rump, both hands on the pumps
Send her home with me, I have your girl yellin', uhh
Kellz, my bitch drunk
But her two girlfriends still wanna have fun
Pass the blunt, let her drink red rum
Bet she ain't never seen a penthouse at the Trump
Me and R. been around the world
And we'll give it to you just how you like it, girl

[Verse 3: R. Kelly]
Girl, you're on a mission
Step into the club, shuttin' down competition
The way you walk it, talk it, switch it
And when the doors close, handle your business
Now make your booty go (Boom boom boom boom)
Break it down now (Boom boom boom boom boom)
Bring it up now (Boom boom boom boom)
Push it back, girl
(Kellz, you crazy for this one)
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it
Out the club, in the coupe to the mansion
We gon' get bent up 'til the morning
Laying back in the chair while you wind it
Lap dance on me girl, bump and grind it
We gon' do it 'til we drop, until the party stop
We gon' keep it hot, oh

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
Playa's only
We where them chicks be jerkin' they bodies
Up in the club where they get real naughty
Take 'em from here to the private party
Where there ain't nothin' but
Playa's only
Where the playas be spendin' a lot of dough
Honeys got ass bouncin' on the floor
This is how we do behind the playa's door

[Bridge: R. Kelly]
I like it when you flip that, bump that, roll that
Shake that, drop that, grope that
Make it go clap-clap
Flip that, bump that, roll that, shake that
Drop that, grope that
Make it go clap-clap

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
Playa's only
We where them chicks be jerkin' they bodies
Up in the club where they get real naughty

"I'm going to give you the lyrics of a song by ""R. Kelly"" entitled ""Playa’s Only"" from 2005. Here are the lyrics:

[Intro: R. Kelly & The Game]
I hope y'all got y'all playa's cards
'Cause y'all ain't gettin' in unless you do
Bounce, it's the new 12-play
Bounce (Game, yo) Throw the pussy like Elway
Bounce (C'mon) I wanna see your tail shake
Bounce, when you hear R. Kellz say

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
Playa's only
We where them chicks be jerkin' they bodies
Up in the club where they get real naughty
Take 'em from here to the private party
Where there ain't nothin' but
Playa's only
Where the playas be spendin' a lot of dough
Honeys got ass bouncin' on the floor
This is how we do behind the playa's door

[Verse 1: R. Kelly]
(She on the floor) Surrounded by them playas and thugs
(She on the floor) The girls goin' wild in the club
(In V.I.P.) Got 'dro with a bottle of bub
(She don't care) Shakin' ass, just throwin' 'em up
I'd really like to know her
The way she runs her
Body up and down, she got me heated up
I can't front, I really wanna beat it up
Show her how I hit the bar and spend it up
You ain't gotta be worried 'bout being alone
'Cause tonight we'll be together in my home
Exit out the club, bouncin' our domes
Got that red coupe matchin' the chrome
Put that body in motion, motion
And watch it wave like a ocean, ocean
Now break it down and worm it, worm it
Now bring it up, now shake it, shake it

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
Playa's only
We where them chicks be jerkin' they bodies
Up in the club where they get real naughty
Take 'em from here to the private party
Where there ain't nothin' but
Playa's only
Where the playas be spendin' a lot of dough
Honeys got ass bouncin' on the floor
This is how we do behind the playa's door

[Verse 2: The Game]
I'm still fresh like, uhh, Impala, uhh
Dre's young gun still ridin' the bass drum
Four times platinum, Hate It Or Love It, I'm still number one
Still in the hood, one hand on my gun
And my trigger finger still make bitches come
I mean the one with the ring in the tongue
Compton, R. Kelly found her in the slumps
Shaking that rump, both hands on the pumps
Send her home with me, I have your girl yellin', uhh
Kellz, my bitch drunk
But her two girlfriends still wanna have fun
Pass the blunt, let her drink red rum
Bet she ain't never seen a penthouse at the Trump
Me and R. been around the world
And we'll give it to you just how you like it, girl

[Verse 3: R. Kelly]
Girl, you're on a mission
Step into the club, shuttin' down competition
The way you walk it, talk it, switch it
And when the doors close, handle your business
Now make your booty go (Boom boom boom boom)
Break it down now (Boom boom boom boom boom)
Bring it up now (Boom boom boom boom)
Push it back, girl
(Kellz, you crazy for this one)
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it
Out the club, in the coupe to the mansion
We gon' get bent up 'til the morning
Laying back in the chair while you wind it
Lap dance on me girl, bump and grind it
We gon' do it 'til we drop, until the party stop
We gon' keep it hot, oh

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
Playa's only
We where them chicks be jerkin' they bodies
Up in the club where they get real naughty
Take 'em from here to the private party
Where there ain't nothin' but
Playa's only
Where the playas be spendin' a lot of dough
Honeys got ass bouncin' on the floor
This is how we do behind the playa's door

[Bridge: R. Kelly]
I like it when you flip that, bump that, roll that
Shake that, drop that, grope that
Make it go clap-clap
Flip that, bump that, roll that, shake that
Drop that, grope that
Make it go clap-clap

[Chorus: R. Kelly]
Playa's only
We where them chicks be jerkin' they bodies
Up in the club where they get real naughty
Take 'em from here to the private party
Where there ain't nothin' but

Where the playas be spendin' a lot of dough

[Intro]
Woo, hahahaha

[Verse 1]
Way on down to southern Alabama
With the guitars jammin', that's where we're headed
Straight up to Butte, Montana
Singin', ""Lord, I was born a ramblin' man""
California to Oregon
Even New York City got one or two hillbillies
Ready to hit the road

It's a brother and a sister kind of thang
Raise up your hands if you all wanna hang with

We live to ride
We ride to live
Me and my gang
Jump on that train
Grab hold of them reins
We gonna rock this thang, cock this thang
Me and my gang, yeah
Yeah, me and my gang

[Verse 2]
We got hippies, gypsies, freaks and geeks
High-class women in Daisy Duke denim
Bangin' on gongs and singin' our songs
Dude named Elrod jammin' on an iPod
Beer and bonfires
And wide-open throttle, Coors in a bottle
It's all for one and one for all, y'all

[Verse 1]
Can I get your hand to write on?
Just a piece of leg to bite on
What a night to fly my kite on
Do you want to flash a light on?

Take a look it's on display for you
Comin' down, no, not today

Get it off with no propeller
Do it up, it's on with Stella
What a way to finally smell her

Pickin' up, but not too strong for you

Fly away on my zephyr
I feel it more than ever
And in this perfect weather
We'll find a place together

[Post-Chorus]
Fly on my wind

[Verse 3]
Rebel and a liberator
Find a way to be a skater
Rev it up to levitate her
Super friendly aviator

[Refrain]
Take a look it's on display, for you
Comin' down, no not today

[Chorus]
Fly away on my zephyr
I feel it more than ever
And in this perfect weather
We'll find a place together

[Post-Chorus]
In the water where I center my emotion
All the world can pass me by
Fly away on my Zephyr
We'll find a place together

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Wo-wo-wo-wo-wo-woah, do you
Yea-yea-yea-yea-yea-yeah
Wo-wo-wo-wo-wo-woah, want to
Yea-yea-yea-yea-yea-yeah

[Chorus]
Fly away on my zephyr
I feel it more than ever
And in this perfect weather
We'll find a place together

In the water where I center my emotion
All the world can pass me by
Fly away on my Zephyr
We're gonna live forever

[Intro: Jessica Gomes]
(May-May-May)
What is this? (May-May-May)
Maybach Music
I like this Maybach Music, hahahaha

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
She's just perfect in every kinda way
But I don't think I can handle her pain
So messed up and I'm too busy just runnin' my game
Oh, girl after girl, mistake after mistake

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown, Rick Ross]
I tried to change, but they always around pullin' me down in bed (May-May)
Gave you my word, but they were just broken promises (Uh)
Broken condoms, lipstick marks and unprotected sex (Uh)
I feel like shit, you know I ain't shit

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Sorry won't turn back the clock
Baby, I took advantage 'cause I knew you
Wouldn't believe it, so I used you
I'm sorry, oh
But sorry don't make it right, I know (May-May-May)

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
We at the crib, she got her legs wrapped around my waist
Conversatin', she lick every tattoo that's on my face
Like a thug, I just wanna fuck, that's every day
Temporary separations, confessin' my mistakes
She packed her bags and left me home and I'm still hurt
You new pussy, but she can't tell me that it's real first
A lot of lies, apologize, the thirst real
When she hear this, thinkin' to herself, ""Damn, this verse real""
Rehab out in Vegas, that made this a murdered sin
Sent the bottles to her table, then made love on the jet
Temporary thrills, all these women you think I tossed
My feelings genuine, disregard what you see on blogs
I been a boss before I recorded Meek song
Mill in cash on the 'Gram, they trendin' Meech home
In the D my G, he throwin' that P-Stone
Every picture that you post, leave comments on each one

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
I'm just a typical ordinary nigga
But I know that I can't change the rules
All this time I blamed you 'cause I know what I'm doing
Steppin' on your heart again, relationship ruined

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown, Rick Ross]
I tried to change, but I'm always out, fuckin' around in the club (May-May)
Pieces of my love letter tore up from this break up (Uh)
My worst nightmare went right in my back, I wish I could wake up (Uh)
I feel like shit, know I ain't shit, but I'm (May-May-May)

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Rick Ross]
Sorry won't turn back the clock
Baby, I took advantage 'cause I knew you
Wouldn't believe it, so I used you
I'm sorry, oh (Gotta love it, baby, uh)
But sorry don't make it right, I know (May-May-May)

[Verse 4: Rick Ross]
Life's short and, baby girl, you deserve a winner
Every day the diamonds on you get bigger and bigger
Hustle from my heart, so every night I can deliver (Uh)
Sayin' sorry, layin' up, I'm way up in your liver (Boss)
Them red bottoms got you walkin' funny (Ha)
Get you a agent, she ballin' and all she talk is money (Right)
Take her shoppin', baby boy, ain't no salary caps (Uh)
She get it poppin', so you better bring battery packs (Huh)
Perfect time to relax
Nothin' is perfect other than me and the perfect match
They all watch me 'cause the moves I make out they budgets
Diamond district, six figures on my shorty nugget

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
I tried to change, but they always around, pullin' me down in bed (May-May-May)
Gave you my word, but they were just broken promises
Broken condoms, lipstick marks and unprotected sex (Yeah)
I feel like shit, you know I ain't shit

[Chorus: Chris Brown]

[Verse 1]
How would you like it if I talked about your skin
The way you wear your hair (Oh girl)
Would you like if I talked about your butt
Or once a month
Turned into someone that was hard to love
How would you like it if I didn't like your smoke
Didn't like your polish you be wearing on your toes
If I didn't like your neck-a-lace
Or what you cooked for breakfast
Would I be wrong?
Would I be wrong?

[Chorus]
Why you wanna change me
Flip all the things that really make me
The way that I am used to make you happy
Baby, why you wanna change me (Girl, oh)
You used to like your big ol' teddy bear (Girl, oh)
You used to let me get it anywhere
Now baby, it's crazy
Why, why
Why you wanna change me?

[Verse 2]
Now what if all I did was pick apart your friends
'Cause they ain't got no ends (Oh girl)
What if I talked about your face in the morning
'Cause we know that you ain't cute in the morning (No)
What If I criticized the way that you be eatin'?
And when you sleepin' you be doin' that heavy breathin'?
What if I was at you 'bout your house creepin'?
Would I be wrong?
Would I be wrong? Oh

Why you wanna change me (Change me)

We used to love breakin' up (knowing we'd be together again)
And we used to love the arguments ('cause we makin' love by the end, yeah)

If it ain't broke then why you wanna change?

How would you like it if I talked about your skin
The way you wear your hair (Oh girl)
Would you like if I talked about your butt
Or once a month
Turned into someone that was hard to love
How would you like it if I didn't like your smoke
Didn't like your polish you be wearing on your toes
If I didn't like your neck-a-lace
Or what you cooked for breakfast
Would I be wrong?
Would I be wrong?

Why you wanna change me

[Verse 2]
Now what if all I did was pick apart your friends
'Cause they ain't got no ends (Oh girl)
What if I talked about your face in the morning
'Cause we know that you ain't cute in the morning (No)
What If I criticized the way that you be eatin'?
And when you sleepin' you be doin' that heavy breathin'?
What if I was at you 'bout your house creepin'?
Would I be wrong?
Would I be wrong? Oh

You used to let me get it anywhere (Anywhere)
Now baby, it's crazy (Crazy)
Why, why (Oh)
Why you wanna change me?

[Bridge]
We used to love breakin' up (knowing we'd be together again)
And we used to love the arguments ('cause we makin' love by the end, yeah)
How you gon' change everything and turn (Turn it all around)
'Cause I don't wanna go, if it ain't gon' be the same
If it ain't broke then why you wanna change?

[Chorus]
Why you wanna change me
Flip all the things that really make me (Why, oh)
The way that I am used to make you happy

I think of the two of us
An' how we both came to trust
In each other

And pleasure can come from pain

"I'm going to give you the lyrics of a song by ""Sweet Sensation"" entitled ""Love Child"" from 1990. Here are the lyrics:

[Intro: Betty LeBron]
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

[Pre-Chorus: Betty LeBron]
You think that I don't feel love
But what I feel for you is real love
In others eyes, I see reflected
A hurt, scorned, rejected

[Chorus: Sweet Sensation]
Love child, never meant to be
Love child, born in poverty
Love child, never meant to be
Love child, take a look at me

[Verse 1: Betty LeBron]
I started my life in an old, cold, rundown tenement slum
My father left, he never even married Mom
I shared the guilt my mama knew
So afraid that others knew I had no name

[Pre-Chorus: Betty LeBron & Sweet Sensation]
This love we're contemplating (Ah-ah)
Is it worth the pain of waiting? (Ah-ah)
We'll only end up hating
The child we may be creating (Ooh-ooh-ooh, oh)

[Chorus: Sweet Sensation]
Love child, never meant to be
Love child, society
Love child, always second best
Love child, different from the rest

[Post-Chorus: Sweet Sensation & Betty LeBron]
Woah, ooh-woah
Ooh-ooh
Woah, ooh-woah
Oh, yeah

[Verse 2: Betty LeBron]
Started school in a worn, torn dress that somebody threw out
I knew the way it felt to always live in doubt
To be without the simple things
So afraid my friends could see the guilt in me

[Pre-Chorus: Betty LeBron & Sweet Sensation]
Don't think that I don't need ya (Ah-ah)
Don't think I don't want to please ya (Ah-ah)
But no child of mine will be bearin'
The name of shame I've been wearin' (Ooh-ooh-ooh, oh)

Love child, never meant to be (Wait, wait, won't you wait now?)
Love child, born in poverty (Hold on, just a little bit longer)

"I'm going to give you the lyrics of a song by ""Taylor Swift"" entitled ""Chloe or Sam or Sophia or Marcus"" from 2024. Here are the lyrics:

[Verse 1]
Your hologram stumbled into my apartment
Hands in the hair of somebody in darkness
Named Chloe or Sam or Sophia or Marcus
And I just watched it happen
As the decade would play us for fools
And you saw my bones out with somebody new
Who seemed like he would've bullied you in school
And you just watched it happen

[Chorus]
If you wanna break my cold, cold heart
Just say, ""I loved you the way that you were""
If you wanna tear my world apart
Just say you've always wondered

[Verse 2]
You said some things that I can't unabsorb
You turned me into an idea of sorts
You needed me, but you needed drugs more
And I couldn't watch it happen
I changed into goddesses, villains, and fools
Changed plans and lovers and outfits and rules
All to outrun my desertion of you
And you just watched it

[Chorus]
If you wanna break my cold, cold heart
Just say, ""I loved you the way that you were""
If you wanna tear my world apart
Just say you've always wondered

[Bridge]
If the glint in my eye traced the depths of your sigh
Down that passage in time back to the moment
I crashed into you, like so many wrecks do
Too impaired by my youth to know what to do

[Verse 3]
So if I sell my apartment
And you have some kids with an internet starlet
Will that make your memory fade from this scarlet maroon
Like it never happened?
Could it be enough to just float in your orbit?
Can we watch our phantoms like watching wild horses?
Cooler in theory, but not if you force it to be
It just didn't happen

[Chorus]
So if you wanna break my cold, cold heart
Say you loved me
And if you wanna tear my world apart
Say you'll always wonder

[Outro]
'Cause I wonder
Will I always
Will I always wonder?

[Verse 1]
Long were the nights
When my days once revolved around you
Counting my footsteps
Prayin' the floor won't fall through again
And my mother accused me of losin' my mind
But I swore I was fine
You paint me a blue sky
Then go back and turn it to rain
And I lived in your chess game
But you change the rules every day
Wonderin' which version of you
I might get on the phone tonight
Well, I stopped pickin' up
And this song is to let you know why

[Chorus]
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I shoulda known

[Verse 2]
Well, maybe it's me and my blind optimism to blame
Or maybe it's you and your sick need
To give love and take it away
And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors
Who don't understand
And I'll look back and regret how I ignored when they said
""Run as fast as you can""

[Chorus]
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
Dear John, I see it all now, it was wrong
Don't you think nineteen's too young to be played by
Your dark, twisted games when I loved you so?
I shoulda known

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
You are an expert at ""Sorry"" and keepin' lines blurry
Never impressed by me acing your tests
All the girls that you run dry have tired, lifeless eyes
'Cause you burned them out
But I took your matches before fire could catch me
So don't look now
I'm shining like fireworks over your sad, empty town
Oh

Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?

Is I know something now
Know something now I didn't before
And all I've seen since eighteen hours ago
Is green eyes and freckles and your smile
In the back of my mind, making me feel like

Taking flight, making me feel right

(You good to go?)

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
All I knew this morning when I woke
Is I know something now
Know something now I didn't before
And all I've seen since eighteen hours ago
Is green eyes and freckles and your smile
In the back of my mind, making me feel like

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift &  Ed Sheeran]
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran]
'Cause all I know is we said, ""Hello""
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
And everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

[Verse 2: Ed Sheeran & Taylor Swift]
And all my walls stood tall, painted blue
And I'll take 'em down, take 'em down
And open up the door for you
And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies
The beautiful kind, making up for lost time
Taking flight, making me feel right

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran]
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran]
'Cause all I know is we said, ""Hello""
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
And everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

[Bridge: Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran]
Come back and tell me why
I'm feeling like I've missed you all this time
And meet me there tonight
And let me know that it's not all in my mind

[Verse 1: Tony Lewis]
Josie's on a vacation far away
Come around and talk it over
So many things that I wanna say
You know I like my girls a little bit older

[Chorus: Tony Lewis]
I just wanna use your love tonight
And I don't wanna lose your love tonight

I ain't got many friends left to talk to
Nowhere to run when I'm in trouble
You know I'd do anything for you
Stay the night but keep it undercover

I just wanna use your love tonight, oh
I don't wanna lose your love tonight

Try to stop my hands from shakin'
'Cause somethin' in my mind's not makin' sense
It's been awhile since we were all alone
I can't hide the way I'm feelin'

Just 'cause you're right, that don't mean I'm wrong

[Chorus]
Ooh-hoo, Jackie blue
Lives her life from inside of a room
Hides that smile when she's wearin' a frown
Ooh Jackie, you're not so down

[Verse 1]
You like your life in a free-form style
You'll take an inch but you'd love a mile
There never seems to be quite enough
Floating around to fill your lovin' cup

[Chorus]
Ooh-hoo, Jackie blue
What's a game, girl, if you never lose
Ask a winner and you'll prob'bly find
Ooh Jackie, they've lost at sometime

[Verse 2]
Don't try to tell me that you're not aware
Of what you're doing and that you don't care
You say it's easy, just a nat'ral thing
Like playing music but you never sing

[Chorus]
Ooh-hoo, Jackie blue
Making wishes that never come true
Going places that you've never been
Ooh Jackie, you're going again

[Break]
{guitar solo}

[Chorus]
Ooh-hoo, Jackie blue
Lives a dream that can never come true
Making love is like siftin' through sand
Ooh Jackie, it slips through your hand

[Verse 3]
Every day, in your indigo eyes
I watch the sun set but I don't see it rise
Moonlight and stars in your strawberry wine
You'd take the world but you won't take the time

[Chorus]
Ooh-hoo, Jackie blue
Lives her life from inside of a room
Makes you think that her life is a drag
Ooh Jackie, what fun you have had

Hey babe won't you tell me what you've got going on

"I'm going to give you the lyrics of a song by ""Van Morrison"" entitled ""Moondance"" from 1977. Here are the lyrics:

[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Well, it's a marvelous night for a moondance
With the stars up above in your eyes
A fantabulous  night to make romance
'Neath the cover of October skies
And all the leaves on the trees are falling
To the sound of the breezes that blow
And I'm trying to please to the calling
Of your heartstrings that play soft and low

[Pre-Chorus]
You know the night's magic seems to whisper and hush
You know the soft moonlight seems to shine in your blush

[Chorus]
Can I just have one more moondance with you, my love?
Can I just make some more romance with you, my love?

[Verse 2]
Well, I want to make love to you tonight
I can't wait 'til the morning has come
And I know now the time is just right
And straight into my arms, you will run
And when you come my heart will be waiting
To make sure that you're never alone
There and then, all my dreams will come true, dear
There and then, I will make you my own

[Pre-Chorus]
And every time I touch you, you just tremble inside
Then I know how much you want me that you can't hide

[Chorus]
Can I just have one more moondance with you, my love?
Can I just make some more romance with you, my love?

[Verse 1]
She's just a fallen angel, and I'm the fool who made her fall
Last night I saw an angel, the one I once called mine
The hand that wore my wedding band held a glass of wine
I took her love for granted, I wronged her night and day
I drove my angel from me, and now she's gone astray

[Chorus]
She's just a fallen angel, but I don't blame her for it all
She's just a fallen angel, and I'm the fool who made her fall

[Steel guitar solo]

[Verse 2]
So many times she told me she couldn't take me much more
So many times I laughed at her and walked right out the door
I wasn't worthy of her, and now my angel's gone
The devil took her from me and claimed her for his own

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Oh, ohh)
I'm a real, I'm a real
I'm a real deal slime

[Chorus]
I'ma ride that red eye (Red eye), like a demon
Stack that money 'til I can't no more (No more)
We be robbin' and schemin' (On God), oh Lord
How long would it be until this pain gon' go?
Straight from the bottom, blow a bag on my bros, oh, yeah, yeah
Just for his head, a hundred thousand, say less, I pay that
Got plenty money, but I had to jump up out my bag

[Verse 1]
I stayed down lately, shawty, I'd die for you
Fuck that shit that he be talkin', did he ride for you?
I jeopardize and send my brothers 'fore to slide for you
And every nigga 'round me willing 'fore to die for you
Who you judgin'? I come up straight from the gutter
We done struggled, me and my brothers had no one but each other
I can buy a hatchback, but can't buy my family back, my life nothin'
I want my Ne back, but I'm caught up with these hoes and I'm thuggin'

[Chorus]
I'ma ride that red eye (Red eye), like a demon
Stack that money 'til I can't no more (No more)
We be robbin' and schemin' (On God), oh Lord
How long would it be until this pain gon' go?
Straight from the bottom, blow a bag on my bros, oh, yeah, yeah
Just for his head, a hundred thousand, say less, I pay that
Got plenty money, but I had to jump up out my bag

[Verse 2]
Ride foreign ride, got plenty money, but that north where I reside at
But I'd fly miles 'cross this town to see you smile
She be fans of other niggas, like this bitch wan' be a hype man
But the minute I wan' be alone, she don't like that
I took heed into your letters, I was locked up with no celly
I ain't wanna be nowhere but with you
From the bottom all the way back to my section
Everyday, yeah, we be steppin'
Fuck chasin', I will not be through
I'm all caught up with money, like, ""Fuck this dream, it ain't nothin'""
And fuck these hoes that don't love me, niggas don't like how I be stuntin'
I miss Big Dump like my granny, we still at war 'bout my cousin
Diggin' 'but I ain't searchin' for gold, I know I'm lookin' for somethin'

[Chorus]
I'ma ride that red eye (Red eye), like a demon
Stack that money 'til I can't no more (No more)

"I'm going to give you the lyrics of a song by ""Zac Brown Band"" entitled ""Colder Weather"" from 2011. Here are the lyrics:

[Verse 1]
She'd trade Colorado if he'd take her with him
Closes the door 'fore the winter lets the cold in
And wonders if her love is strong enough to make him stay
She's answered by the taillights shinin' through the window pane

[Chorus]
He said, I want to see you again
But I'm stuck in colder weather
Maybe tomorrow will be better
Can I call you then?
She said, you're ramblin' man
And you ain't ever gonna change
You've got a gypsy soul to blame
And you were born for leavin'

[Verse 2]
At a truck stop diner, just outside of Lincoln
The night is black as the coffee he was drinkin'
And in the waitress' eyes he sees the same old light is shinin'
He thinks of Colorado and the girl he left behind him

[Chorus]
He said, I want to see you again
But I'm stuck in colder weather
Maybe tomorrow will be better
Can I call you then?
She said, you're ramblin' man
And you ain't ever gonna change
You've got a gypsy soul to blame
And you were born for leavin'
Born for leavin'

[Bridge]
Well, it's a windin' road
When you're in the lost and found
You're a lover, I'm a runner
And we go 'round and 'round
And I love you, but I leave you
I don't want you, but I need you
You know it's you that calls me back here, baby

[Alternate Chorus]
Oh, I want to see you again
But I'm stuck in colder weather
Maybe tomorrow will be better
Can I call you then?
'Cause I'm a ramblin' man
I ain't ever gonna change
I've got a gypsy soul to blame
And I was born for leavin'
Born for leavin'

[Outro]
When I close my eyes I see you
No matter where I am
I can smell your perfume through these whisperin' pines
I'm with your ghost again
It's a shame about the weather
But I know soon we'll be together
And I can't wait 'til then
I can't wait 'til then

[Verse 1]
I ride east every other Friday
But if I had it my way
A day would not be wasted on this drive
And I want so bad to hold you
Son, there's things I haven't told you
Your mom and me couldn't get along

[Chorus]
So I'll drive
And I think about my life
And wonder why
That I slowly die inside
Every time I turn that truck around right at the Georgia line
And I count the days and the miles back home to you
On that Highway 20 ride

[Verse 2]
A day might come you'll realize
That if you see through my eyes
There was no other way to work it out
And a part of you might hate me
But son, please don't mistake me
For a man that didn't care at all

[Chorus]
And I'll drive
And I'll think about my life
And wonder why
That I slowly die inside
Every time I turn that truck around right at the Georgia line
And I count the days and the miles back home to you
On that Highway 20 ride

[Outro]
So when you drive
And the years go flying by
I hope you smile
If I ever cross your mind
It was a pleasure of my life
And I cherished every time
And my whole world
It begins and ends with you
